  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Erev Shabbat, Schnein Asar 2, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Responsibility for another’s property / Justice - damages and liability</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“If a man delivers to his neighbor money or goods to keep, and it is stolen out of the man’s house… if the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges.”<br />
     - Shemot (Exodus) 22:7–8</p>

  <p>“If a man causes a field or vineyard to be grazed… he shall make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard.”<br />
     - Shemot (Exodus) 22:5</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <h4>Responsibility for another’s property</h4>
  <p>The Torah teaches that when something is entrusted to us, we become responsible for its care. Trust creates obligation. Whether property, resources, or even influence, what belongs to another must be guarded with diligence.</p>

  <p>Responsibility is not casual stewardship. It requires attentiveness, honesty, and accountability. To neglect what has been placed in our hands is to fail both our neighbor and YHVH.</p>

  <h4>Justice - damages and liability</h4>
  <p>The Torah establishes clear principles for damages. When harm is caused - whether intentional or careless - restitution must follow. Justice restores balance.</p>

  <p>Liability teaches restraint. It reminds us that our actions have consequences beyond ourselves. True righteousness includes foresight, responsibility, and willingness to repair what we damage.</p>

  <p>As we enter Shabbat, these themes unite: guard what is entrusted, and repair what is harmed. Covenant living is built on trust and justice.</p>

  <h3>💙 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Today consider:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do I treat what is entrusted to me with full responsibility?</li>
    <li>Am I careful that my actions do not cause harm to others?</li>
    <li>When damage occurs, do I step forward to restore it?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Trust and justice strengthen community.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, You are righteous and faithful in all Your ways. Teach us to be trustworthy stewards of what is placed in our care. Guard our hands from negligence and our hearts from indifference. Establish in us integrity and accountability.</p>

  <p>Bring peace to the Middle East, to South Africa, and to the nations of the world. Restrain violence, calm unrest, and guide leaders toward justice and wisdom.</p>

  <p>Pour out a true end-time revival. Awaken hearts to repentance, truth, and covenant faithfulness.</p>

  <p>Protect the elderly, especially those suffering abuse or neglect. Defend their dignity and provide them with safety and compassionate care.</p>

  <p>Guard the farmers, especially those in danger of attacks. Surround them with protection and stability in their communities.</p>

  <p>Strengthen those living in disaster-stricken areas, especially in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Provide relief, restoration, and hope where there has been loss.</p>

  <p>Encourage evangelists across the world, especially in countries where they face persecution. Grant them boldness, protection, and fruitfulness.</p>

  <p>Bring healing to the sick, especially those battling cancer and emerging viral diseases spreading rapidly. Grant wisdom to caregivers and comfort to families.</p>

  <p>Prepare us for the days ahead as signs increase. Establish us firmly in faith, endurance, and discernment in times of tribulation.</p>

  <p>Bless and establish our ministry, Derech Olam Ministries. Guide its work, protect its path, and let it serve faithfully according to Your purpose.</p>

  <p>As Shabbat preparation continues, settle our hearts in peace. May trust, justice, and restoration mark our lives.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

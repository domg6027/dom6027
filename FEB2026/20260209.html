  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Sheni, 20 Echad Asar 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Justice - protection of the weak</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.”<br />
     - Shemot (Exodus) 22:21</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>YHVH’s justice is always protective toward those with little power - the stranger, the poor, the widow, the orphan, and the vulnerable.</p>

  <p>To walk in Torah is to use our strength not for domination, but for shelter; not for advantage, but for advocacy. Justice in YHVH’s eyes is measured by how we treat those who cannot repay us.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>True righteousness shows itself in daily choices:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do we listen to the unheard?</li>
    <li>Do we defend those who are easily ignored?</li>
    <li>Do we speak up when something is unfair - even when it is uncomfortable?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Today we are invited to reflect the heart of YHVH, who sees the weak and raises them up.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, form in us a just and compassionate heart. Guard us from hardness, indifference, or abuse of power. Teach us to stand with those who are overlooked and to act with integrity in every situation. May our lives mirror Your righteous character.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

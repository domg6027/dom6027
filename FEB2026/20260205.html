  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Chamishi, Echad Asar 16, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Compassion for the vulnerable</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing.”<br />
     — Devarim (Deuteronomy) 10:18</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>YHVH consistently reveals Himself as the Defender of those who cannot defend themselves. Compassion is not optional charity — it is covenant responsibility. To belong to YHVH’s people means to mirror His heart toward widows, orphans, strangers, the poor, and the oppressed.</p>

  <p>This mitzvah calls us beyond mere emotion. True compassion is expressed through action, fairness, protection, and practical care. YHVH’s justice is always paired with mercy, and His holiness is reflected when His people refuse to ignore suffering around them.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Compassion shapes the moral character of a community. Where indifference grows, injustice flourishes. Where mercy prevails, righteousness is established.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Who in your sphere may be vulnerable, overlooked, or silenced?</li>
    <li>Do your words protect them, or do they add to their burden?</li>
    <li>Does your time, prayer, or generosity reflect YHVH’s care for the weak?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Walking in covenant means seeing people through YHVH’s eyes — not as burdens, but as souls He deeply values.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, compassionate and just, teach us Your heart for the vulnerable. Break our indifference and awaken us to the needs around us. Give us courage to speak for those who cannot speak, to defend those who are mistreated, and to care for those in need. May our lives reflect Your mercy, righteousness, and love.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

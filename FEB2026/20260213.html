  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Erev Shabbat, 24 Echad Asar 6027 AA</h2>

  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEMES</h3>
  Timely payment for labor / Fair treatment of workers</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall give him his wages on the same day, before the sun sets, for he is poor and sets his heart on it; lest he cry out against you to YHVH, and it be sin to you.”<br>
     - Devarim (Deuteronomy) 24:15</p>

  <p>“Masters, grant to your servants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.”<br>
     - Colossians 4:1</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <h4>Timely payment for labor</h4>
  <p>The Torah reminds us that righteousness is revealed in how we treat those who labor among us. Timely payment is not merely administrative efficiency - it is obedience to YHVH and protection for the vulnerable.</p>

  <p>Workers depend on their wages to sustain their households. Delaying or manipulating payment is a form of injustice. Fair treatment goes beyond wages; it includes respect, honesty, safe conditions, and recognition of human dignity.</p>

  <p>In honoring those who work for us or alongside us, we reflect the justice and compassion of YHVH Himself.</p>

  <h4>Fair treatment of workers</h4>
  <p>Fair treatment of workers extends beyond paying wages on time. The Torah calls us to recognize that every worker bears the image of YHVH and must be treated with dignity, respect, and justice.</p>

  <p>This includes honest agreements, reasonable expectations, safe conditions, and words that build up rather than degrade. Authority in the workplace is never permission for harshness or exploitation. Leadership, whether in business, ministry, or home, is stewardship under YHVH’s authority.</p>

  <p>When we treat workers fairly, we testify that righteousness governs our decisions. When we honor their humanity, we reflect the character of the One who sees every act of injustice and every act of kindness.</p>

  <p>Fair treatment becomes part of our spiritual preparation - ensuring that our relationships are aligned with justice before we enter His rest.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  As we prepare for Shabbat, let us consider:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do I handle financial obligations promptly and faithfully?</li>
    <li>Do I treat workers with respect and fairness?</li>
    <li>Does my conduct in business reflect covenant integrity?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>True preparation for Shabbat includes making right what may be owed and walking in peace with others.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>

  <p>YHVH Elohim, You are righteous in all Your ways and faithful in all Your works. Teach us to walk uprightly in our financial dealings and relationships. Guard us from exploitation, negligence, and indifference. Make us people who honor labor, respect dignity, and act with integrity.</p>

  <p>We pray for peace in Middle East, South Africa and the world. May Your shalom overcome violence, division, and unrest, and establish righteousness among the nations.</p>

  <p>We pray for end-time revival. Pour out Your Spirit in power and truth, awakening hearts to repentance and covenant faithfulness.</p>

  <p>We pray for the elderly, especially those subject to abuse and neglect. Protect them, restore their dignity, and raise up advocates who will care for them with compassion.</p>

  <p>We pray for the farmers, especially those in danger of attacks. Surround them with safety and strengthen their hands as they provide food and stability for communities.</p>

  <p>We pray for people living in disaster stricken areas, especially in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Bring relief, provision, and restoration to those who have suffered loss and hardship.</p>

  <p>We pray for evangelists all over the world, especially in those countries where they are persecuted. Grant them boldness, protection, and fruit that remains.</p>

  <p>We pray for ill people, especially those with cancer and new viral diseases that are spreading like wildfires. Stretch out Your healing hand and grant comfort, endurance, and recovery.</p>

  <p>We pray for the coming tribulation as the signs of the birth pains are here already. Prepare Your people with steadfast faith, discernment, and unwavering trust in You.</p>

  <p>We also pray for our ministry (Derech Olam Ministries). Establish the work of our hands, provide what is needed, and let it bear lasting fruit for Your Kingdom.</p>

  <p>May we enter Shabbat with clean hands, pure hearts, and peaceful consciences.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

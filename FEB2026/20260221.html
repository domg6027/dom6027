  <h2>🌟 SHABBAT MESSAGE - Schnein Asar 3, 6027 AA 🌟</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>✨ <strong>THEME</h3>
  <p>Promise and testing (Bereshit / Genesis 16–18)</p>

  <h3>👐 OPENING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, King of the universe, we enter Your Shabbat with reverence and gratitude. Thank You for covenant, for promise, and for Your faithfulness across generations. Open our hearts to receive Your Word today. Strengthen us where we are tested, and anchor us in trust where we are waiting. Let Your Spirit guide us into truth and deeper obedience.</p>

  <h3>🍷 COMMUNION</h3>
  <p>As we partake of the cup and the bread, we remember the covenant confirmed through promise and fulfilled through obedience. Just as Avraham trusted You before the promise was fully visible, so we trust You. We receive with thanksgiving the provision of redemption and renew our commitment to walk faithfully before You.</p>

  <h3>📜 TORAH READING</h3>
  <p>“And He brought him outside and said, ‘Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.’ And He said to him, ‘So shall your seed be.’ And he believed YHVH, and He counted it to him as righteousness.”<br />
     - Bereshit (Genesis) 15:5–6</p>

  <h3>📖 MESSAGE</h3>
  <p>In these chapters (16–18) we witness both the promise and the testing of that promise. Delay, uncertainty, and human weakness appear — yet YHVH remains faithful.</p>

  <p>The life of Avraham teaches that promise does not eliminate testing. In fact, promise often invites it. Between the word spoken and the fulfillment manifested lies a space where faith must mature.</p>

  <p>Sarai’s impatience, Hagar’s distress, and Avraham’s intercession reveal the human dimension of waiting. Yet in Bereshit 18, YHVH reaffirms what He has declared. What He speaks, He sustains.</p>

  <p>Testing exposes whether we rely on our own solutions or remain anchored in covenant trust. Promise is not fragile — but our faith can be refined.</p>

  <p>Shabbat reminds us that fulfillment does not come through striving. It comes through trusting the One who promised.</p>

  <h3>💙 APPLICATION</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Am I trying to “help” a promise along through my own effort?</li>
      <li>Where is YHVH asking me to wait faithfully?</li>
      <li>How can I intercede for others while trusting His timing in my own life?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Promise requires patience. Testing produces endurance. Faith anchors both.</p>

  <h3>👐 CLOSING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, establish us in unwavering trust. When delay tempts us to act outside Your will, steady our hearts. When circumstances test our faith, remind us of Your covenant faithfulness. Teach us to wait with integrity, to act with obedience, and to trust without fear. May our lives reflect righteousness born of belief.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

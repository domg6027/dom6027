  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Shlishi, Schnein Asar 6, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Justice – accountability for injury</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“If men contend with each other, and one strikes the other… he shall surely pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.”<br />
     - Shemot (Exodus) 21:18–19</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>Justice in the Torah is not abstract - it is practical and restorative. When injury occurs, accountability follows. The one who causes harm is responsible not only for the immediate damage, but also for the consequences that follow. This principle establishes dignity for the injured and responsibility for the one who caused harm. Time lost, pain endured, healing required - these matter before YHVH. Justice acknowledges the real cost of injury.</p>

  <p>Accountability restrains violence and protects community. It reminds us that our actions carry weight. Words, anger, negligence - all can wound. Torah justice insists that harm must be addressed, not ignored. Yet embedded in this instruction is restoration. The goal is not vengeance, but healing. True justice seeks to repair what was broken and to restore balance where it was disturbed.</p>

  <h3>💙 REFLECTION</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do I take responsibility when my actions wound others?</li>
    <li>Am I quick to pursue restoration where harm has occurred?</li>
    <li>Do I recognize the value of another person’s time, well-being, and dignity?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Justice preserves peace when accountability is embraced.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, establish justice within us. Guard us from causing injury through anger or carelessness. Where harm has occurred, grant us humility to accept responsibility and pursue restoration. Teach us to value the well-being of others and to act with righteousness in all our dealings.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

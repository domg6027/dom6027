  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Shlishi, Echad Asar 28, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Restitution for wrongdoing</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“If anyone sins and commits a trespass against YHVH by deceiving his neighbor… then it shall be, because he has sinned and is guilty, that he shall restore what he has taken… and add a fifth part to it.”<br />
     - Vayikra (Leviticus) 6:2–5</p>

  <p>“When a man or woman commits any sin against another… he shall confess the sin which he has done, and he shall make full restitution… and add to it a fifth.”<br />
     - Bamidbar (Numbers) 5:6–7</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>Restitution is more than apology. The Torah teaches that when wrong has been done, restoration must follow. Confession addresses the heart; restitution addresses the harm.</p>

  <p>Wrongdoing disrupts trust, damages relationships, and disturbs covenant order. The command to restore - and even to add beyond what was taken - reflects a principle of responsibility and humility. True repentance seeks not only forgiveness but repair.</p>

  <p>Restitution acknowledges that sin is not abstract. It affects real people, real property, and real peace. Covenant faithfulness requires courage to correct what we have damaged.</p>

  <h3>💙 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Today consider:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Have I made right what I have wronged?</li>
    <li>Is there unresolved harm that requires practical restoration?</li>
    <li>Do I seek forgiveness without also seeking repair?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Restoration rebuilds trust and strengthens the community.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, You are righteous and just. Teach us to walk in honesty and responsibility. Give us courage to confess where we have failed and humility to restore what we have harmed. Establish in us hearts that seek not only pardon but peace. May our repentance be complete and our relationships renewed.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

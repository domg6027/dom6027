  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – YOM SHENI, ECHAD ASAR 13, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Prohibition of hatred in the heart</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.”<br />
     — Vayikra (Leviticus) 19:17</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>YHVH does not only judge outward actions; He searches the heart. Hidden resentment, bitterness, or silent contempt can be just as destructive as open wrongdoing. The mitzvah forbidding hatred in the heart teaches us that covenant faithfulness requires inner alignment with YHVH’s character, not merely polite behavior.</p>

  <p>Instead of allowing offense to harden into hatred, YHVH calls His people to truthful, respectful confrontation and reconciliation. Loving correction — spoken with humility — protects both parties and preserves the community. Guarding the heart is therefore a spiritual discipline: we refuse to harbor poison and instead cultivate truth, patience, and mercy.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Is there anyone toward whom you are silently holding resentment? What would repentance, release, or honest conversation look like today?</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, search our hearts and reveal any hidden bitterness or hatred within us. Give us courage to speak truth in love, grace to forgive, and humility to walk in reconciliation. Shape us into a people who reflect Your righteousness and Your compassion.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – YOM SHLISHI, ECHAD ASAR 14, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Reproof with responsibility</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.”<br />
     — Vayikra (Leviticus) 19:17</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>YHVH commands not only that we avoid hatred, but that we take responsibility for truth within our relationships. Reproof is not permission to judge harshly, vent frustration, or embarrass another — it is a sacred duty carried out with care, humility, and covenant love.</p>

  <p>Silence in the face of wrongdoing can become complicity, yet rebuke without compassion becomes cruelty. True responsibility means we correct others for their restoration, not our vindication. It requires prayer, discernment, and a clean heart before speaking.</p>

  <p>This mitzvah teaches that community faithfulness depends on mutual accountability. When we speak truth in righteousness, we protect both the individual and the people of YHVH from the slow corrosion of sin.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Have you ever avoided necessary correction out of fear, discomfort, or pride? How might you speak truth more faithfully — and more lovingly — when YHVH calls you to it?</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, teach us to carry reproof with responsibility. Guard our tongues from anger, pride, or condemnation. Give us wisdom to speak at the right time, courage to speak the truth, and compassion to seek restoration. Make us a people who love enough to correct and humble enough to be corrected.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

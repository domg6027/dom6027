  <h2>🌟 SHABBAT MESSAGE - Schnein Asar 10, 6027 AA - Week 9 of 52 🌟</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>✨ THEME</h3>
  <p>Justice and Intercession (Bereshit / Genesis 19–21)</p>

  <h3>👐 OPENING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>Father YHVH, we enter Your Shabbat with gratitude and reverence. Thank You for the gift of rest and for Your righteous judgments which are true and faithful. Open our hearts to understand Your justice and teach us to stand before You as faithful intercessors.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h3>🍷 COMMUNION</h3>
  <p>As we partake of the bread and the cup, we remember that justice and mercy meet in the covenant of redemption. YHVH is righteous in all His ways, yet He makes provision for deliverance. Let us examine our hearts before Him. May we receive His mercy with humility and commit ourselves to walk in righteousness before Him.</p>

  <h3>📜 TORAH READING</h3>
  <p>“Then YHVH rained upon Sodom and upon Gemorrah brimstone and fire from YHVH out of the heavens.”<br>
  - Bereshit (Genesis) 19:24</p>

  <p>“And YHVH remembered Sarah as He had said, and YHVH did for Sarah as He had spoken.”<br>
  - Bereshit (Genesis) 21:1</p>

  <p>“And Elohim heard the voice of the lad; and the Messenger of Elohim called to Hagar out of heaven…”<br>
  - Bereshit (Genesis) 21:17</p>

  <h3>📖 MESSAGE</h3>
  <p>These chapters reveal both the severity and the tenderness of divine justice. Judgment fell upon Sodom and Gemorrah because wickedness had reached its fullness. Yet even in judgment, mercy was present - Lot was delivered, and Hagar and her son were heard in the wilderness. Intercession preceded destruction. Avraham stood before YHVH and pleaded for the righteous. His intercession mattered. Justice was executed, but compassion was not absent.</p>

  <p>In the birth of Yitzchak, we see another dimension of justice: covenant faithfulness. What YHVH promised, He fulfilled. Justice establishes what is right according to His word.</p>

  <p>Justice and intercession together reveal the character of the Most High - righteous, faithful, and attentive to the cry of those who call upon Him.</p>

  <h3>💙 APPLICATION</h3>
  <p>Today ask yourself:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Am I willing to stand in the gap for others, even when circumstances seem beyond change?</li>
    <li>Do I trust that YHVH’s justice is perfect and that His promises will surely come to pass?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This Shabbat, let us commit to lives marked by integrity before Elohim and compassion toward people.</p>

  <h3>👐 CLOSING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, You are just and You are merciful. Teach us to walk uprightly and to intercede faithfully. Make us instruments of peace and righteousness in our generation. Establish our hearts in truth and anchor us in Your covenant promises.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

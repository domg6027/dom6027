  <h2>🌅 YOM RISHON - Schnein Asar 4, 6027 AA 🌅</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>✨ <strong>THEME</strong></h3>
  <p>Guarding against negligence</p>

  <h3>📜 <strong>READING</strong></h3>
  <p>“Only take heed to yourself, and diligently keep yourself, lest you forget the things your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life.”<br />
     - Devarim (Deuteronomy) 4:9</p>

  <h3>🟫 <strong>MITZVOT FOCUS</strong></h3>
  <p>Negligence rarely begins with open rebellion. More often, it begins with small compromises - a postponed responsibility, an ignored conviction, a delayed correction. Over time, what was once clear becomes blurred.</p>

  <p>Guarding against negligence requires awareness. It calls us to pay attention to what we have been taught, what we have witnessed, and what we have committed before YHVH. When we become casual about truth, discipline weakens. When discipline weakens, accountability fades.</p>

  <p>The Torah repeatedly urges vigilance - not fear, but attentiveness. To guard is to value. To remember is to protect. Spiritual maturity grows where consistency is honored.</p>

  <p>If we begin with intentionality, the days that follow are strengthened. AND if we start every deed we do with "B'shem YHVH" we set the tone for our lives before we do it.</p>

  <h3>💙 <strong>REFLECTION</strong></h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Is there an area where I have become spiritually inattentive?</li>
      <li>Have I delayed obedience in something small?</li>
      <li>What practical step can I take today to correct it?</li>
      <li>Do we start everything with "B'shem YHVH" to honor Him alone?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Diligence prevents decline. Watchfulness preserves covenant alignment.</p>

  <h3>👐 <strong>PRAYER</strong></h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, keep us from drifting into carelessness. Sharpen our awareness and renew our commitment to walk uprightly. Where we have been negligent, grant us courage to correct it quickly. Let this week be marked by faithfulness, responsibility, and steady obedience before You. And let us honour You and Your Name in all we do.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

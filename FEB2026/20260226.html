  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Chamishi, Schnein Asar 26, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Prohibition of False Oaths</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You do not bring the Name of YHVH your Elohim to naught, for YHVH does not leave the one unpunished who brings His Name to naught.”<br />
     - Shemot (Exodus) 20:7</p>

  <p>“And do not swear falsely by My Name and so profane the Name of your Elohim. I am YHVH.”<br />
     - Vayyikra (Leviticus) 19:12</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>We are commanded not to swear falsely in the Name of YHVH. An oath invokes His authority and holiness. To attach His Name to deception, exaggeration, or empty promises is to profane what is set-apart.</p>

  <p>This mitzvah calls us to integrity - that our words be truthful without the need for dramatic vows. When we speak, especially invoking the Name, we represent His character.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>In a world where promises are easily broken and words are casually spoken, YHVH calls His people to a higher standard. Truthfulness is not optional; it is covenantal. When we use His Name lightly or attach it to something untrue, we distort His reputation before others. But when our yes is truly yes and our no is truly no, we reflect His faithfulness.</p>

  <p>Let us examine our speech. Do we make commitments we do not intend to keep? Do we speak impulsively and later regret our words? This mitzvah invites us into disciplined, reverent speech rooted in truth.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, You are faithful and true in all Your ways. Guard our lips and purify our speech. Teach us to honor Your Name with reverence and integrity. May our words be trustworthy, our promises sincere, and our lives reflect Your holiness.</p>

  <p>Set a watch over our mouths, and help us walk in truth before You and before others.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

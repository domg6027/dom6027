  <h2>🌟 SHABBAT MESSAGE - 25 Echad Asar 6027 AA 🌟</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha! Shabbat Shalom!</strong></p>

  <h3>✨ THEME</h3>
  <p>Covenant call</p>

  <h3>👐 OPENING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, Covenant-Keeper and Faithful One, as we enter Your Shabbat rest, quiet our hearts before You. Open our ears to hear Your call and strengthen us to walk in obedience. As You called Abram out from his homeland, call us deeper into trust, faith, and covenant faithfulness. Establish Your Word within us today.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h3>🍷 COMMUNION</h3>
  <p>As Abram believed YHVH and it was counted to him as righteousness, we remember that covenant begins with trust. We partake of the bread and the cup in remembrance of the covenant promises fulfilled and unfolding. May this time renew our faith, anchor us in righteousness, and remind us that we belong to the Covenant Elohim who keeps His Word from generation to generation.</p>

  <h3>📜 READING</h3>
  <p>“Now YHVH said to Abram: ‘Go forth from your land and from your kindred and from your father’s house, to the land which I will show you. And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you; and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing.’”<br />
     - Bereshit (Genesis) 12:1-2</p>

  <p>“And he believed YHVH; and He counted it to him for righteousness.”<br />
     - Bereshit (Genesis) 15:6</p>

  <p>“And He said to him, ‘I am YHVH who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to inherit it.’”<br />
     - Bereshit (Genesis) 15:7</p>

  <h3>📖 MESSAGE</h3>
  <p>The covenant call begins with separation and trust. Abram was called to leave what was familiar and secure in order to walk toward a promise not yet visible. Covenant relationship requires movement - a willingness to step forward at the voice of YHVH.</p>

  <p>In Bereshit 12 to 15 we see the pattern of covenant: calling, promise, belief, and divine confirmation. Abram did not earn righteousness through works; he responded in faith. His belief aligned him with YHVH’s purposes. The covenant call is not only about land or lineage; it is about becoming a blessing. YHVH’s promises carry responsibility. When He calls, He forms a people who reflect His character and carry His light.</p>

  <p>Shabbat reminds us that covenant is sustained not by striving, but by trusting. The same Elohim who calls also confirms, protects, and fulfills His promises.</p>

  <h3>💙 APPLICATION</h3>
  <p>On this Shabbat, reflect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are there places where YHVH is calling you to deeper trust?</li>
    <li>What familiar patterns must be released to walk fully in covenant?</li>
    <li>How can you become a blessing within your household, community, and calling?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Covenant faith grows through obedience and rest - stepping forward when He speaks and resting when He confirms.</p>

  <h3>👐 CLOSING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH, thank You for Your covenant call. Strengthen us to obey even when the path is not fully revealed. Count our faith as righteousness as we trust in You. Establish Your promises in our lives, and make us a blessing to others. Guard our households and keep us anchored in Your covenant mercy.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

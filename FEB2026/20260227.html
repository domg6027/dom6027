  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - EREV SHABBAT, Schnein Asar 9, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>🌟 THEME</h3>
  <p>Reverence for Vows and Commitments / Justice – Integrity before Elohim / Justice – Integrity before People</p>

  <h3>📖 READING</h3>
  <p>“When you make a vow to YHVH your Elohim, do not delay to pay it, for YHVH your Elohim shall certainly require it of you, and it shall be sin in you.”<br>
     - Devarim (Deuteronomy) 23:21</p>

  <p>“You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment. Do not be partial to the poor or favor the face of the great, but judge your neighbor in righteousness.”<br>
     - Vayyikra (Leviticus) 19:15</p>

  <p>“You shall not pervert the judgment of your needy brother in his dispute.”<br>
     - Shemot (Exodus) 23:6</p>

  <h3>✨ MESSAGE</h3>
  <h4>Reverence for Vows and Commitments</h4>
  <p>A vow is not merely words spoken into the air; it is a binding commitment made before the Most High. To delay, neglect, or treat it lightly reflects a divided heart.</p>

  <h4>Justice – Integrity before Elohim</h4>
  <p>Justice begins in the unseen place — in motives, thoughts, and intentions. Elohim sees beyond appearances and measures truth from the inward parts. When our inner life aligns with His standards, righteous judgment flows naturally in our dealings with others.</p>

  <h4>Justice – Integrity before People</h4>
  <p>Integrity before people is the visible fruit of integrity before Elohim. We are called to fairness without favoritism, to compassion without compromise, and to truth without distortion.</p>

  <p>As we prepare to enter Shabbat, let us examine our commitments, our judgments, and our relationships. Let our “yes” be faithful, our decisions just, and our hearts aligned with His righteousness.</p>

  <h3>📖 REFLECTION</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Have we made promises that remain unfulfilled?</li>
    <li>Have we judged situations with partiality or allowed emotions to cloud fairness?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Erev Shabbat is a gift - a pause to realign. Before we step into rest, we restore integrity. We honor what we have spoken. We choose righteousness in hidden places and visible ones.</p>

  <h3>🙌 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>Father YHVH, as we prepare for Your Shabbat, we come with humility and sincerity. Search our hearts and reveal anything that is not aligned with Your truth. Strengthen us to keep our vows and honor our commitments. Let us enter Shabbat with clean hands and pure hearts, honoring You in word, deed, and judgment.</p>

  <p>We pray for peace in the Middle East, South Africa, and the world. Bring stability, righteousness, and divine intervention where conflict rises.</p>

  <p>We pray for end-time revival. Let hearts awaken and turn back to Your truth across the earth.</p>

  <p>We pray for the elderly, especially those suffering abuse or neglect. Surround them with protection, dignity, care, and comfort.</p>

  <p>We pray for the farmers, especially those in danger of attacks. Shield their lives, strengthen their hands, and bless their labor.</p>

  <p>We pray for people living in disaster-stricken areas, especially in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Provide relief, restoration, and hope in every place of loss.</p>

  <p>We pray for evangelists across the world, especially where persecution is severe. Empower them with courage, safety, and supernatural doors of opportunity.</p>

  <p>We pray for ill people, especially those with cancer and new viral outbreaks. Stretch out Your healing hand and bring restoration and hope.</p>

  <p>We pray for the coming tribulation and the signs already appearing. Prepare our hearts with wisdom, endurance, and steadfast faith.</p>

  <p>We pray for our ministry, Derech Olam Ministries. Guide each step, open the right doors, and let Your favor rest upon the work.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

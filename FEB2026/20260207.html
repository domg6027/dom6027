  <h2>🌟 SHABBAT, ECHAD ASAR 18, 6027 AA 🌟</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>✨ THEME</h3>
  <p>Nations and dispersion (Genesis 10–11)</p>

  <h3>👐 OPENING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, Sovereign over all nations, we come before You on this holy Shabbat with reverence and gratitude. Still our hearts from the noise of the world and draw us into Your rest. Open our eyes to see Your purposes in history, Your justice among the nations, and Your mercy toward all peoples. Teach us humility, obedience, and trust in Your perfect ways.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h3>🍷 COMMUNION</h3>
  <p>As we partake in communion, we remember that YHVH’s covenant reaches beyond one tribe or tongue. Through Yahusha, He restores unity between heaven and earth and calls all nations back to Himself. We examine our hearts, repent of pride and division, and renew our commitment to walk in obedience, humility, and love.</p>

  <h3>📜 TORAH READING</h3>
  <p>“These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.”<br />
     — Genesis 10:32</p>

  <p>“Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because YHVH did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did YHVH scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.”<br />
     — Genesis 11:9</p>

  <h3>📖 MESSAGE</h3>
  <p>After the Flood, humanity spread across the earth, forming nations, languages, and cultures. Genesis 10 shows YHVH’s order in this diversity - peoples distributed according to His design. Yet Genesis 11 reveals a deeper issue: the Tower of Babel was not merely about building a city, but about human pride, self-exaltation, and rebellion against YHVH’s command to fill the earth.</p>

  <p>Instead of trusting YHVH’s plan, humanity sought unity without obedience and power without submission. Therefore, YHVH confused their language and scattered them - not as punishment alone, but as protection against collective arrogance and corruption. Dispersion became both judgment and mercy.</p>

  <p>This pattern reminds us that YHVH rules over all nations. No empire, government, or coalition stands above His authority. He disperses the proud, humbles the exalted, and preserves His covenant people within the flow of history. Yet His ultimate purpose is not division, but restoration - a day when people from every nation will worship Him in truth and unity grounded in obedience, not rebellion.</p>

  <p>Shabbat calls us to remember that true unity does not come from human ambition, but from submission to YHVH’s Torah and His HaMashiach, Yahusha.</p>

  <h3>💙 APPLICATION</h3>
  <p>Ask yourself today:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Where might pride or self-reliance be shaping your decisions instead of trust in YHVH?</li>
    <li>Do you seek unity through conformity, or through obedience to YHVH’s truth?</li>
    <li>How can you honor YHVH’s design for diversity while pursuing peace and righteousness?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Let this Shabbat be a time to repent of pride, embrace humility, and align our lives with YHVH’s sovereign plan for the nations.</p>

  <h3>👐 CLOSING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, King of all the earth, thank You for Your righteous governance over the nations. Deliver us from the spirit of Babel - pride, control, and rebellion. Teach us to walk humbly before You, to trust Your timing, and to seek unity through obedience to Your Word. May Your purposes for the nations unfold according to Your will, and may we be faithful witnesses of Your truth.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

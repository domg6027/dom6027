  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Erev Shabbat, Echad Asar 17, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Prohibition of oppression by words / Prohibition of oppression by actions</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall not oppress one another, but you shall fear your Elohim; for I am YHVH your Elohim.”<br />
     — Vayikra (Leviticus) 25:17</p>

  <p>“You shall not oppress your neighbor or rob him. The wages of a hired servant shall not remain with you all night until morning.”<br />
     — Vayikra (Leviticus) 19:13</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <h4>Prohibition of oppression by words</h4>
  <p>This mitzvah reminds us that oppression is not only physical or economic — it can also be carried in speech, tone, accusation, and careless words. YHVH links our use of language directly to our reverence for Him. To fear YHVH means to guard how we speak to and about others.</p>

  <p>Words can wound, manipulate, shame, or control — but they can also heal, build, correct, and restore. Covenant obedience calls us to reject verbal cruelty, mockery, coercion, or belittling speech, and instead to speak truth with dignity, restraint, and compassion.</p>

  <h4>Prohibition of oppression by actions</h4>
  <p>This mitzvah extends beyond words to how we treat others in practice — in power, money, relationships, and authority. Oppression can appear in exploitation, unfair pressure, withholding help, manipulation of systems, or taking advantage of someone’s vulnerability. YHVH calls His people to reject any behavior that diminishes another person’s dignity or freedom.</p>

  <p>True covenant obedience requires that our actions reflect justice, restraint, and mercy. We are not permitted to use strength, status, or position to dominate others, but are instead called to protect, serve, and uplift those who are weaker.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Oppression by words often hides in everyday interactions: sarcasm that humiliates, rumors that destroy trust, or pressure that violates conscience. When we normalize such behavior, we fracture community and dishonor YHVH’s Name.</p>

  <p>Oppression often hides behind “normal” behavior — harsh workplace demands, financial unfairness, social exclusion, or silent neglect of those in need. When we ignore these patterns, we become complicit.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Where might my words have harmed rather than helped?</li>
    <li>Do I correct others with humility or with dominance?</li>
    <li>Does my speech create peace or tension?</li>
    <li>Where might my actions burden others rather than bless them?</li>
    <li>Do I use power to control, or to serve?</li>
    <li>Am I part of systems that harm the vulnerable — and how can I change that?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As we prepare for Shabbat, we are invited to cleanse our speech so that our rest is not polluted by unresolved conflict or careless words and deeds. Justice is not only spoken; it must be lived.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, guard our tongues and purify our hearts. Deliver us from harsh, reckless, or manipulative speech. Teach us to speak truth with love, to rebuke with wisdom, and to build others up rather than tear them down. May our words reflect Your holiness and justice. Keep our hands from oppression and teach us to act with justice, mercy, and covenant faithfulness.</p>

  <p>We pray for peace in the Middle East, South Africa, and the world. Bring stability where there is chaos and restrain violence by Your hand.</p>

  <p>We pray for end-time revival. Awaken hearts across the nations to return to Your Torah and covenant.</p>

  <p>We pray for the elderly, especially those subject to abuse and neglect. Surround them with protection, dignity, and compassionate care.</p>

  <p>We pray for the farmers, especially those in danger of attacks. Shield their lives and bless the work of their hands.</p>

  <p>We pray for people in disaster-stricken areas, especially in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Provide relief, shelter, and swift restoration.</p>

  <p>We pray for evangelists around the world, especially where they are persecuted. Grant them courage, safety, and open doors for Your Word.</p>

  <p>We pray for ill people, especially those with cancer and new viral diseases. Stretch out Your healing hand and restore their bodies.</p>

  <p>We pray for the coming tribulation as birth pains are already visible. Prepare our hearts with endurance and steadfast faith.</p>

  <p>We pray for our ministry, Derech Olam Ministries. Guide our steps, open righteous doors, and let Your favor rest upon the work.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

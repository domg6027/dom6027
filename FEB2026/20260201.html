  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - YOM RISHON, ECHAD ASAR 12, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Love of one’s fellow</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall love your neighbour as yourself.”<br />
     - Vayikra (Leviticus) 19:18</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>To actively practice covenantal love that reflects YHVH’s character - not sentimental feeling, but righteous action. This includes guarding our speech from slander, gossip, or contempt; refusing to exploit, manipulate, or ignore others; and choosing fairness, patience, and mercy even when we are inconvenienced or misunderstood.</p>

  <p>Loving one’s fellow means defending the vulnerable, correcting in truth without cruelty, forgiving when possible, and seeking reconciliation rather than division. It also means examining our own motives so that our “service” to others is not driven by pride, reputation, or control, but by genuine obedience to YHVH’s Torah.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Where did my words, attitudes, or silence wound someone yesterday? Where did I justify unkindness as “truth,” or impatience as “efficiency”? Today, what one concrete act of Torah-shaped love can I intentionally practice — such as making peace, speaking gently, sharing resources, protecting someone from harm, or humbling myself to ask forgiveness?</p>

  <p>How can I align my heart with YHVH so that love becomes a daily habit rather than an occasional emotion?</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, circumcise our hearts so that we may truly love as You command. Deliver us from hardness, selfishness, and spiritual pride. Teach us to see others as You see them, and to act in justice, mercy, and faithfulness. May our obedience bring healing to our homes, our communities, and Your people. Shape us into servants who walk in the footsteps of YAHUSHA, in holiness and truth.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Shishi, 19 Echad Asar 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Prohibition of oppression by actions</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall not oppress one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am YHVH your Elohim.”<br />
     - Vayikra (Leviticus) 25:17</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>YHVH commands His people to avoid harming others through power, position, or behavior. This includes not humiliating, manipulating, exploiting, or pressuring anyone — especially the vulnerable, the poor, the stranger, or the dependent.</p>

  <p>To fear YHVH means our actions toward others must reflect His justice and compassion.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Oppression is not only loud cruelty; it can be quiet neglect, careless words, or subtle misuse of authority. Today we are invited to examine how we treat those around us - at home, at work, and in community - and to align our conduct with the character of YHVH.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, give us hearts that tremble before You and act with mercy toward others. Cleanse us from any ways we have wronged our neighbor. Teach our hands to build, not to break, and our words to heal, not to wound. May our lives honor Your Torah and Your Name.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <p>Shalom until tomorrow.</p>

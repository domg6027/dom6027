  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Revi'i, Schnein Asar 7, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Truthfulness in speech</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall not bear false report. Do not put your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.”<br />
     - Shemot (Exodus) 23:1</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>Truthfulness is a foundation of covenant life. The Torah forbids not only direct lying, but also spreading false reports, repeating unverified information, or aligning ourselves with distortion. Speech carries weight. Words can establish justice or corrupt it. To bear false witness is to damage trust. It injures reputations, weakens community, and disrupts righteousness. Even passive participation - repeating what we have not confirmed - can make us partners in harm.</p>

  <p>Truthfulness requires restraint. It calls us to examine what we say, why we say it, and whether it reflects integrity. Silence can sometimes be more righteous than careless speech. When our words align with truth, they strengthen justice and preserve peace. Faithfulness in speech reflects faithfulness in heart.</p>

  <h3>💙 REFLECTION</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do my words consistently reflect truth?</li>
    <li>Am I careful not to repeat what I have not verified?</li>
    <li>Does my speech build trust or weaken it?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Guarded speech protects both justice and community.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, guard our tongues and purify our speech. Keep us from falsehood, exaggeration, and careless reporting. Teach us integrity in what we say and restraint in what we repeat. Let our words reflect truth, justice, and covenant faithfulness.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

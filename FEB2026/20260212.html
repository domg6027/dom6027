  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Chamishi, 23 Echad Asar 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Prohibition of withholding wages</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall not oppress your neighbor or rob him. The wages of a hired worker shall not remain with you all night until the morning.”<br />
     - Vayikra (Leviticus) 19:13</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>YHVH commands fairness in our economic relationships. Withholding wages is a form of oppression because it harms those who depend on timely payment to live and provide for their families.</p>

  <p>This mitzvah teaches that righteousness is not only spiritual - it is practical, financial, and relational. Justice must show up in how we pay, treat, and honor those who work for us.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Today we reflect:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do I act with integrity in money matters?</li>
    <li>Do I delay what is owed out of convenience or control?</li>
    <li>Do I treat workers, helpers, or employees as people made in YHVH’s image?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Faithfulness to YHVH is revealed in honest and timely dealings with others.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, teach us to act justly in all our financial dealings. Guard our hearts from greed, negligence, or exploitation. Help us to honor every worker with fairness, respect, and compassion. May our conduct reflect Your righteousness in the marketplace and in our homes.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Chamishi, Schnein Asar 1, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>🌙 MOON STATUS</h3>
  <p>The new moon was sighted very late last night (after 22h00) in South Africa. With confirmed sighting, we enter Schnein Asar 1, 6027 AA.</p>

  <p>Please ensure that each community verifies sightings within its own country or region, as local confirmation establishes the beginning of the month.</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Returning lost property</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them; you shall surely bring them back to your brother.”<br />
     - Devarim (Deuteronomy) 22:1</p>

  <p>“And so shall you do with every lost thing of your brother’s… you may not hide yourself.”<br />
     - Devarim (Deuteronomy) 22:3</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>The Torah commands active responsibility when encountering what belongs to another. Righteousness is not passive. If we see loss and ignore it, we participate in the harm.</p>

  <p>Returning lost property restores more than an object; it restores trust and strengthens covenant community. The repeated instruction not to “hide yourself” reveals the heart of the command. Indifference is not permitted.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of a new month, this mitzvah calls us to renewed attentiveness - to see clearly, to act faithfully, and to guard what belongs to others as carefully as we guard our own.</p>

  <h3>💙 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Today consider:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do I turn away from responsibility when it is inconvenient?</li>
    <li>Am I attentive to opportunities to restore what is lost?</li>
    <li>Do I value another’s property as I value my own?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>True belief according to the Torah includes renewed responsibility.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, You restore what is lost and gather what is scattered. Teach us not to hide ourselves from responsibility. Give us attentive eyes and willing hands to return what belongs to others. Establish integrity and compassion within our community.</p>

  <p>As this new month begins, bless the work of our hands and the paths before us. Renew our strength, protect our households, and align us with Your covenant order. May this month be marked by faithfulness, restoration, and peace.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

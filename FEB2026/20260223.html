  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Schnein Asar 5, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  Prohibition of causing harm</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h2>
  <p>“If a man causes a field or vineyard to be grazed, and lets his animal loose so that it feeds in another man’s field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard.”<br />
     - Shemot (Exodus) 22:5</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>The Torah establishes a clear boundary: we are not permitted to cause damage - whether intentionally or through carelessness. Even indirect harm carries responsibility. To “let loose” what we control - our animals, our property, our influence, our words - without restraint can bring loss to another. Covenant life requires vigilance over what is in our power.</p>

  <p>The commandment does more than require restitution; it teaches prevention. We are called not only to repair harm, but to guard against causing it in the first place. Restraint is righteousness in action. Awareness is protection for community. When we take responsibility for what is under our control, peace is preserved.</p>

  <h3>💙 REFLECTION</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Is there something under my control that could cause harm if left unchecked?</li>
    <li>Am I attentive to the consequences of my actions?</li>
    <li>Do I prioritize prevention over repair?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Guarding others from harm is an expression of covenant love.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, guard our hands, our speech, and our influence. Keep us from causing harm through neglect or impulse. Teach us restraint, foresight, and responsibility. Where harm has occurred, lead us to restoration. Let our lives reflect care, protection, and righteousness toward others.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

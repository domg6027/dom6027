  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Revi’i Echad Asar 15, 6027 AA (Tu BiShvat)</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Justice – honest weights and measures</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall do no injustice in judgment, in measures of length, weight, or quantity. You shall have honest balances, honest weights, an honest ephah, and an honest hin: I am YHVH your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.”<br />
     — Vayikra (Leviticus) 19:35–36</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>This mitzvah calls us to integrity not only in business, but in character. Justice is not merely a legal standard – it is a spiritual posture. YHVH links honest measures directly to redemption from Egypt, reminding us that His people are freed from systems of deception, exploitation, and manipulation.</p>

  <p>To walk in covenant means that fairness must govern our trade, our speech, our decisions, and even our inner motives. When we treat others justly, we reflect the justice of our Redeemer.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Honest weights are about more than commerce – they shape the moral economy of a community. When deception creeps into everyday dealings, trust erodes, relationships fracture, and the witness of YHVH’s people is weakened. Justice begins in the heart before it appears in the marketplace.</p>

  <p>Today we are invited to examine not only what we do, but how we measure people:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do we give others grace or do we weigh them down with harsh judgment?</li>
    <li>Do we inflate our own importance while minimizing the needs of others?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Walking in righteousness means aligning our standards with YHVH’s standards – fair, consistent, and compassionate. As we prepare for the season of growth signaled by Tu BiShvat, may our lives bear the fruit of honesty and fairness.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, Giver of justice and truth, purify our hearts from deceit. Teach us to measure rightly, to judge fairly, and to walk with integrity in all our dealings. May our lives reflect Your righteousness, and may our hands build trust, not harm. Establish us as a people who honor You through honesty and mercy.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <p>Shalom until tomorrow.</p>

  <h2>🌿 TU BISHVAT NOTE – STATE OF THE TREES AND SEASONAL SIGNS</h2>
  <p>Across Israel, almond trees are already in bloom in early February – especially in the Jerusalem hills and northern regions. Their pink and white blossoms are one of the first visible signs that winter is yielding to spring.</p>

  <p>At the same time, anemones and other wildflowers are emerging, carpeting fields and hillsides with color – indicating that winter rains have been sufficient to awaken the land.</p>

  <p>While blossoms are not a direct barley test, they strongly suggest that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The agricultural cycle is advancing normally,</li>
    <li>Vegetation is actively growing, and</li>
    <li>Barley is likely past dormancy and entering early developmental stages.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>These signs lean toward a “normal year” pattern rather than Leyatzev (13th month) – though final confirmation depends on direct barley inspection closer to Aviv stage next month.</strong></p>

  <p>May this Tu BiShvat remind us that just as trees are judged by their fruit, so too are we called to bear righteous fruit before YHVH. 🌳</p>

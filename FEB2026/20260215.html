  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Rishon, 26 Echad Asar 6027 AA</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Justice - honest weights and measures</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall not have in your bag differing weights, a large and a small. You shall not have in your house differing measures, a large and a small. A perfect and just weight you shall have, a perfect and just measure you shall have, that your days may be lengthened in the land which YHVH your Elohim gives you.”<br />
     - Devarim (Deuteronomy) 25:13-15</p>

  <p>“Diverse weights are an abomination to YHVH, and dishonest scales are not good.”<br />
     - Mishlei (Proverbs) 20:23</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>Honest weights and measures form the foundation of economic justice. In ancient markets, merchants could easily manipulate scales for personal gain. The Torah addresses this directly because integrity in small transactions reflects the condition of the heart.</p>

  <p>Justice is not abstract. It is practiced in daily dealings - in pricing, reporting, contracts, and promises. Dishonesty may seem minor or unnoticed, but YHVH calls it an abomination because it distorts truth and harms trust.</p>

  <p>A “perfect and just measure” speaks of consistency. Our standards must not shift depending on advantage. Covenant faithfulness requires that we deal fairly whether someone is watching or not.</p>

  <h3>💙 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>As we begin this new week, consider:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Are my financial dealings transparent and consistent?</li>
    <li>Do I measure others by the same standard I expect for myself?</li>
    <li>Does integrity guide my private decisions as much as my public ones?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Justice begins with honest measures - in business, relationships, and speech.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, You are righteous and true in all Your judgments. Establish integrity within us. Guard us from subtle dishonesty and from standards that shift for convenience. Teach us to walk in fairness, transparency, and truth. May our dealings reflect Your justice, and may our lives be weighed and found faithful before You.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

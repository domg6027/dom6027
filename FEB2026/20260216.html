  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Prohibition of theft</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall not steal.”<br />
     - Shemot (Exodus) 20:15</p>

  <p>“You shall not steal; neither shall you deal falsely, nor lie one to another.”<br />
     - Vayikra (Leviticus) 19:11</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>The prohibition of theft is clear and direct. It protects property, dignity, and trust within the community. Theft is not limited to taking physical objects; it includes deception, withholding what is due, misrepresentation, and exploiting another’s vulnerability.</p>

  <p>At its core, theft is a violation of trust and an expression of coveting what does not belong to us. The Torah teaches that integrity in ownership reflects respect for YHVH’s order. What we possess is entrusted to us; what belongs to another must be honored as theirs.</p>

  <p>Even small acts of dishonesty weaken the fabric of community life. Covenant living requires honesty not only in public actions but also in hidden intentions.</p>

  <h3>💙 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Today consider:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do I handle others’ property and resources with care and respect?</li>
    <li>Am I fully honest in my agreements and representations?</li>
    <li>Are there subtle areas where I justify what is not rightfully mine?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Guarding against theft is guarding the integrity of the heart.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, You are the giver of every good gift. Teach us to be content with what You have entrusted to us. Cleanse us from covetousness and hidden dishonesty. Establish truth in our hearts and integrity in our actions. May we walk uprightly and honor what belongs to others as we honor You.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Revi'i, Echad Asar 29, 6027 AA</h2>

  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Prohibition of robbery</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall not steal; neither shall you deal falsely, nor lie one to another.”<br />
     - Vayikra (Leviticus) 19:11</p>

  <p>“You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him. The wages of him who is hired shall not remain with you all night until the morning.”<br />
     - Vayikra (Leviticus) 19:13</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>Robbery differs from theft in that it is often open, forceful, or oppressive. It includes taking through intimidation, withholding wages, exploiting power, or benefiting from another’s vulnerability.</p>

  <p>The Torah makes clear that oppression and robbery are serious violations of covenant life. To deprive another person of what is rightfully theirs - whether by force, delay, manipulation, or authority - is to disrupt justice and dishonor YHVH’s order.</p>

  <p>Righteousness requires more than refraining from hidden wrongdoing; it demands fairness and promptness in our dealings. Integrity protects the weak and restrains the strong.</p>

  <h3>💙 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Today consider:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do I use influence or position in ways that disadvantage others?</li>
    <li>Am I prompt and fair in fulfilling financial and personal obligations?</li>
    <li>Have I justified delay or pressure that harms another?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Guarding against robbery means guarding against misuse of power.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, You are just and upright. Guard our hands from oppression and our hearts from misuse of power. Teach us to deal fairly, act promptly, and protect what belongs to others. As the new moon approaches, renew our vision and align us with Your righteous order.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <p>Shalom until tomorrow.</p>

  <h3>🌙 MOON SIGHTING</h3>
  <p>As we approach the turning of the month, lift your eyes at sunset and watch the western horizon. The first visible crescent marks renewal and the beginning of a new cycle.</p>

  <p>Observation requires patience and clarity. Just as the moon emerges from hiddenness, so renewal begins in attentiveness. If sighted, let it be received with gratitude and witness.</p>

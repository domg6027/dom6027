  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Rishon, Asiri 21, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ <strong>THEMES</strong></h3>
  <p>Knowledge of Elohim / Justice – Truthful Testimony</p>

  <h3>📘 <strong>READING</strong></h3>
  <p>"Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that YHVH he is Elohim in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.”<br>
     – Deuteronomy 4:39</p>

  <p>“Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.”<br />
     – Exodus 23:7</p>

  <h3>🟫 <strong>MITZVOT FOCUS</strong></h3>
  <h4><em><strong>Knowledge of Elohim</strong></em></h4>
  <p>The Torah commands us not merely to believe in Elohim, but to know Him. Knowledge of Elohim begins with recognizing His absolute sovereignty over heaven and earth and submitting our hearts to that truth. This knowledge is not intellectual curiosity – it is covenant awareness that shapes loyalty, obedience, and fear of YHVH. A people who know their Elohim do not waver with culture or opinion; they stand anchored in what He has declared.</p>

  <p>To grow in the knowledge of Elohim requires disciplined study of His Torah, meditation on His works, and a life that responds to His instruction. Knowing Him produces discernment, stability, and humility, because it keeps the heart aligned with His authority rather than self-will.</p>

  <h4><em><strong>Justice — Truthful Testimony</strong></em></h4>
  <p>Justice cannot exist without truth. The Torah commands us to keep far from falsehood because lies corrupt judgment, destroy trust, and protect wickedness. Truthful testimony is not only about courts and trials – it governs every word spoken, every report given, and every witness made in the community of Elohim.</p>

  <p>When truth is preserved, righteousness is protected and the innocent are defended. When truth is twisted or withheld, injustice is allowed to grow. The mitzvah of truthful testimony therefore safeguards the moral structure of society and reflects the character of Elohim, who is faithful and true in all His ways.</p>

  <h3>🩵 <strong>REFLECTION</strong></h3>
  <p>Those who truly know Elohim will speak truth. These two mitzvot are inseparable: knowledge shapes integrity, and integrity confirms knowledge. A people rooted in both become a pillar of righteousness in a confused world.</p>

  <h3><strong>PRAYER</strong></h3>
  <p>YHVH, teach us to know You in truth and to walk in reverence before You. Guard our words from falsehood and establish justice in our hearts. May our lives and our testimony reflect Your faithfulness in all things.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

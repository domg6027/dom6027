  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Shlishi, Asiri 30, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>🌙 <strong>MONTH STATUS NOTE</strong></h3>
  <p>The new moon was not sighted anywhere, and therefore <strong>Echad Asar</strong>, the eleventh month of the calendar, will begin tomorrow, YHVH willing.</p>

  <h3>⭐ <strong>THEME</strong></h3>
  <p>Faithful Stewardship of Responsibility</p>

  <h3>📘 <strong>READING</strong></h3>
  <p>“It is required of stewards that one be found faithful.”<br />
     — 1 Corinthians 4:2</p>

  <p>“He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much.”<br />
     — Luke 16:10</p>

  <h3>🟫 <strong>MITZVOT FOCUS</strong></h3>
  <p>The mitzvah of stewardship reminds us that every responsibility entrusted to us – time, resources, influence, or authority – belongs ultimately to YHVH. Faithfulness is not defined by the size of the task, but by the integrity with which it is carried out. Torah obedience calls for diligence, accountability, and consistency, even when responsibilities appear ordinary or unseen.</p>

  <p>Stewardship requires awareness that actions have consequences beyond the present moment. When responsibilities are handled carelessly, trust is eroded and order is disrupted. Faithful stewardship, however, preserves righteousness and reflects reverence for the One who assigns every role and measure.</p>

  <h3>🩵 <strong>REFLECTION</strong></h3>
  <p>Faithfulness is revealed through daily responsibility. When stewardship is practiced with humility and discipline, obedience becomes steady and trustworthy. This mitzvah teaches us that covenant faithfulness is expressed not only through belief, but through careful, dependable action.</p>

  <h3>👐 <strong>PRAYER</strong></h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, teach us to be faithful stewards of all that You place in our care. Guard us from neglect, complacency, and misuse of responsibility. Establish integrity within our actions so that our lives may honor You in every assignment entrusted to us.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

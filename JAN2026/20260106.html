  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – YOM SHLISHI, ASIRI 16, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Ordered Inheritance and Covenant Responsibility</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.”<br />
     – Bemidbar (Numbers) 27:8–11</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>These mitzvot establish YHVH’s authority over inheritance when a man dies without a son. The Torah sets a defined order of succession so that property is not seized, manipulated, or distributed according to human emotion or power. The estate is transferred according to covenant instruction, ensuring continuity of the family line and protection of rightful heirs.</p>

  <p>This mitzvah teaches that inheritance is not ownership by force, but stewardship under divine law. It restrains greed, prevents disputes, and guards against injustice after death. By assigning inheritance through Torah order, YHVH preserves dignity, stability, and peace within the community, even in moments of loss.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>The Torah does not allow death to create disorder. Even when a household loses its head, YHVH’s instruction stands as a safeguard against chaos. This mitzvah reminds us that righteousness is measured not only by how we live, but by how responsibly we leave things behind.</p>

  <p>Legacy in the Torah is not accidental. It is shaped by obedience. When lives are ordered according to YHVH’s instruction, peace continues beyond a single lifetime.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH, Elohim of justice and order, teach us to steward all that You entrust to us according to Your Torah. Help us prepare our lives with wisdom and humility, so that peace, clarity, and righteousness remain after us. Let our legacy reflect obedience to Your instruction and trust in Your ways.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

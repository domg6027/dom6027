  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Chamishi, Asiri 11, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>The Mixed Multitude’s Craving</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting; and the children of Yisrael also wept again, and said, ‘Who shall give us flesh to eat?’”<br />
     — Bemidbar (Numbers) 11:4
  </p>

  <h3>🟫 FOCUS</h3>
  <p>In the wilderness, justice was tested not by conflict alone, but by desire. The mixed multitude allowed craving to become complaint, and complaint to become accusation. What began as appetite ended as unrest that spread through the camp.</p>

  <p>This incident reveals a subtle injustice: demanding what is not owed. The people were sustained daily by YHVH, yet they framed desire as entitlement and longing as grievance. Justice was distorted when provision was dismissed and craving was elevated to a claim.</p>

  <p>Unchecked desire creates false claims. It pressures leadership, poisons community trust, and reframes generosity as insufficiency. The Torah shows that justice cannot survive where appetite governs judgment.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>YHVH discerns the difference between need and craving. When desire becomes loud, justice becomes blurred. Many claims are pressed not because of wrong suffered, but because restraint was abandoned.</p>

  <p>Ask yourself today:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do I mistake desire for entitlement?</li>
    <li>Do I voice dissatisfaction in ways that undermine gratitude?</li>
    <li>Do my claims build order, or stir unrest among others?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Justice requires discipline of desire before discipline of law.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, guard our hearts from restless craving. Teach us contentment with what You provide and discernment between need and desire. Keep us from pressing unjust claims born of appetite or comparison. May our trust in You preserve peace, order, and righteousness within the camp.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

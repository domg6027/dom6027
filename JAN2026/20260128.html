  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Revi'i Echad Asar 8, 6027 AA</h2>

  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Sanctity of the community</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity.”<br />
     - Tehillim (Psalm) 133:1</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>The sanctity of the community is preserved when the people of YHVH live in unity, mutual responsibility, and reverence for His instruction. Community is not merely a gathering of individuals, but a set-apart body where conduct, speech, and relationships are shaped by covenant faithfulness. Each member bears responsibility not only for personal holiness, but for safeguarding the spiritual integrity of the whole.</p>

  <p>To honour the sanctity of the community requires restraint, humility, and care for one another. Division, unchecked speech, and disregard for others weaken what YHVH has joined together. This mitzvah calls the community to protect unity through righteous conduct, accountability, and commitment to peace, so that the dwelling place of YHVH among His people is not profaned.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>When community is treated as sacred, unity becomes a testimony. Faithfulness is strengthened through shared responsibility, and the presence of YHVH is honoured through peace and order. A sanctified community reflects the character of YHVH, making His ways visible through the way His people live together.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, teach us to guard the sanctity of our community, to walk in unity and humility, and to honour Your presence among us through faithful love and righteous conduct.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – EREV SHABBAT, ECHAD ASAR 10, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>🌟 THEME</h3>
  <p>Justice – pursuit of righteousness / Preparation for obedience</p>

  <h3>📖 READING</h3>
  <p>“Justice, justice you shall pursue, so that you may live and inherit the land which YHVH your Elohim is giving you.”<br />
     – Devarim (Deuteronomy) 16:20</p>

  <p>“If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine.”<br />
     – Shemot (Exodus) 19:5</p>

  <h3>✨ MESSAGE</h3>
  <h4>Justice – pursuit of righteousness</h4>
  <p>YHVH’s call to justice is not theoretical. It is active, lived, and rooted in righteousness. Justice requires truth, discernment, and faithfulness to His instructions, even when compromise appears easier. As His people, we are commanded to pursue justice deliberately, reflecting His character in our decisions, relationships, and conduct.</p>

  <h4>Preparation for obedience</h4>
  <p>True obedience does not begin at the moment of rest; it begins in preparation. Erev Shabbat reminds us that alignment with YHVH is intentional. Preparing our hearts, homes, and priorities is an act of submission, demonstrating readiness to walk according to His will. Obedience is formed before Shabbat and revealed within it.</p>

  <h3>📖 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Where is YHVH calling you to pursue justice more faithfully? How does intentional preparation today shape your obedience as you enter Shabbat?</p>

  <h3>🙌 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, as we prepare to enter Your holy Shabbat, teach us to pursue justice and to walk in righteousness. Align our hearts with Your truth and prepare us for obedience in every area of life.</p>

  <p>We pray for peace in the Middle East, South Africa, and the world. Bring stability, righteousness, and divine intervention where conflict rises.</p>

  <p>We pray for end-time revival. Let hearts awaken and turn back to Your truth across the earth.</p>

  <p>We pray for the elderly, especially those suffering abuse or neglect. Surround them with protection, dignity, care, and comfort.</p>

  <p>We pray for the farmers, especially those in danger of attacks. Shield their lives, strengthen their hands, and bless their labor.</p>

  <p>We pray for evangelists across the world, especially where persecution is severe. Empower them with courage, safety, and supernatural doors of opportunity.</p>

  <p>We pray for ill people, especially those with cancer and new viral outbreaks. Stretch out Your healing hand and bring restoration and hope.</p>

  <p>We pray for the coming tribulation and the signs already appearing. Prepare our hearts with wisdom, endurance, and steadfast faith.</p>

  <p>We pray for our ministry, Derech Olam Ministries. Guide each step, open the right doors, and let Your favor rest upon the work.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h3>📨 EREV SHABBAT DAVAR LECHEM – ASIRI 19, 6027 AA</h3>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h4>⭐ THEME</h4>
  <p><strong>Justice Tempered with Restraint and Human Dignity</strong></p>

  <h4>📘 READING</h4>
  <p>“When a man hath committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day.”<br />
     – Devarim (Deuteronomy) 21:22–23</p>

  <p>“If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked. And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.”<br />
    – Devarim (Deuteronomy) 25:1–3</p>

  <h4>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h4>
  <p>The Torah establishes different judicial verdicts so that punishment is measured according to guilt and never exceeds what justice requires. Verdicts are not interchangeable; each one reflects the seriousness of the offense and the responsibility of the judge to act with precision.</p>

  <p>Even after lawful execution, the body is not left overnight. Human dignity is upheld, and the land is not defiled. An allowance is made for distant family to arrive, showing that justice does not erase compassion or honor for the dead.</p>

  <p>Flogging is permitted only within strict limits. The Torah fixes a maximum number of lashes to prevent cruelty, humiliation, and abuse of authority. Punishment may correct wrongdoing, but it may never strip a person of their humanity. These mitzvot restrain power and bind judgment to reverence for life.</p>

  <h4>🩵 REFLECTION</h4>
  <p>Justice without limits becomes violence, and mercy without order becomes chaos. The Torah binds authority with restraint and judgment with dignity. As we approach Shabbat, we are reminded that YHVH’s justice is firm yet measured, corrective yet compassionate.</p>

  <p>True righteousness is not found in severity, but in obedience to divine boundaries.</p>

  <h4>👐 PRAYER</h4>
  <p>YHVH, Elohim of justice and order, help all judges, magistrates, and all who exercise authority in judgment. Grant them wisdom, fear of YHVH, integrity, and the courage to judge with righteousness, restraint, and compassion, so that justice upholds human dignity and reflects Your divine order. Give us the discernment of what is right too in order that we can stay within Your Torah and Will.</p>

  <p>We pray for peace in the Middle East, South Africa, and the world. Bring the spirit of SHALOM to end strife, violence, and unrest in these regions.</p>

  <p>We pray for end-time revival. Awaken hearts to repentance, truth, and obedience as the appointed times draw near.</p>

  <p>We pray for the elderly, especially those subject to abuse and neglect. Protect them, restore their dignity, and place them under compassionate care.</p>

  <p>We pray for the farmers, especially those in danger of attacks. Guard their lives, strengthen their hands, and establish justice and safety in the land.</p>

  <p>We pray for people living in disaster-stricken areas, especially in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Bring relief, protection, restoration, and compassionate support to all who have been affected.</p>

  <p> We pray for evangelists all over the world, especially in countries where they are persecuted. Strengthen them with courage, protection, and unwavering faithfulness.</p>

  <p>We pray for the ill, especially those with cancer and rapidly spreading diseases. Bring healing where possible, endurance where needed, and wisdom to those who care for them.</p>

  <p>We pray concerning the coming tribulation, as the signs of the birth pains are already evident. Grant discernment, preparedness, and steadfast faith to Your people.</p>

  <p>We pray for our ministry, <strong>Derech Olam Ministries</strong>. Guide every step, provide what is needed, and keep the work aligned with Your will and truth.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

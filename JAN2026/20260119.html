  <h3>📘 READING</h3>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <h4><strong><em>Integrity in Honest Dealing</em></strong></h4>
  <p>The mitzvah of honest weights and measures establishes integrity as a foundation of covenant life. Torah righteousness is not confined to worship or speech, but is revealed in daily transactions, decisions, and responsibilities. Integrity requires consistency between what is professed and what is practiced, ensuring that no advantage is gained through deception or imbalance.</p>

  <p>Honest dealing reflects trust in YHVH’s provision rather than reliance on manipulation. When integrity governs conduct, justice is preserved and relationships remain uncorrupted. This mitzvah teaches that faithfulness is measured not by appearance, but by fairness and accountability in ordinary life.</p>

  <h4><strong><em>Loving the Stranger and the Vulnerable</em></strong></h4>
  <p>The command to love the stranger calls Israel to remember its own history of dependence and deliverance. Compassion is not optional within the covenant; it is a direct expression of obedience. Loving the vulnerable requires intentional care, protection, and dignity toward those without social or economic security.</p>

  <p>This mitzvah guards the community against hardness of heart and self-centeredness. By extending love beyond familiarity, we mirror YHVH’s mercy and uphold justice that is rooted in remembrance, humility, and responsibility toward others.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Integrity and compassion together reveal a life shaped by Torah. Honest conduct preserves justice, while love for the vulnerable preserves mercy. These mitzvot call us to live with awareness that every interaction is an opportunity to reflect covenant faithfulness.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, establish integrity within our actions and compassion within our hearts. Guard us from dishonesty, indifference, and pride. Teach us to walk faithfully before You, loving others and honoring Your Torah in all that we do.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

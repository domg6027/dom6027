  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Chamishi, Echad Asar 2, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Walking in Integrity Before YHVH</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will be found out.”<br />
     — Mishlei (Proverbs) 10:9</p>

  <p>“You shall be blameless before YHVH your Elohim.”<br />
     — Devarim (Deuteronomy) 18:13</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>The mitzvah of integrity calls us to live with consistency between belief, speech, and action. Integrity is not merely honesty when observed, but faithfulness when unseen. Torah teaches that a life aligned with truth establishes security, stability, and trust, both before Elohim and among people.</p>

  <p>Walking in integrity requires intentional choices. It means refusing compromise even when shortcuts seem beneficial, and remaining obedient when obedience is costly. Integrity anchors the servant of YHVH in righteousness, guarding the heart from deception and preserving the covenant path set before us.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Integrity is revealed through daily decisions rather than public moments. When actions remain faithful to Torah regardless of circumstance, life becomes steady and trustworthy. This mitzvah reminds us that obedience is not situational, but continual.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, establish integrity within our hearts and align our actions with Your Torah. Guard us from compromise and hidden dishonesty, and strengthen us to walk faithfully before You in every circumstance. Let our lives reflect truth, obedience, and reverence for Your Name.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

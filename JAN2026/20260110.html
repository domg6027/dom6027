  <h2>🌟 SHABBAT MESSAGE – ASIRI 20, 6027 AA 🌟</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>✨ <strong>THEME</strong></h3>
  <p>Creation Established by Divine Order</p>

  <h3>👐 <strong>OPENING PRAYER</strong></h3>
  <p>YHVH, Creator of heaven and earth, we come before You acknowledging that all things exist by Your word and are sustained by Your will. As we enter Shabbat, separate us from the noise of the week and draw us into the order, peace, and light You established from the beginning. Set our hearts apart to honor You as Creator and Sustainer.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h3>🍷 <strong>COMMUNION</strong></h3>
  <p>As creation began through YHVH's spoken word, so redemption is remembered by true believers through obedience and remembrance. We set this time apart to acknowledge that life, provision, and rest come from You alone. As we partake in this moment of remembrance, we testify that our lives are ordered by YHVH's instruction and upheld by His faithfulness.</p>

  <h3>📜 <strong>TORAH READING</strong></h3>
  <p>“In the beginning Elohim created the heaven and the earth.”<br />
     – Bereshit (Genesis) 1:1</p>

  <p>“And Elohim said, Let there be light: and there was light.”<br />
     – Bereshit (Genesis) 1:3</p>

  <p>“And Elohim saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good.”<br />
     – Bereshit (Genesis) 1:31</p>

  <h3>📖 <strong>MESSAGE</strong></h3>
  <p>Creation reveals that nothing exists by chance. YHVH brings order where there was formlessness and establishes boundaries where there was no distinction. Light is separated from darkness, waters from land, and time itself is structured into days. This divine order becomes the foundation upon which all Torah instruction rests.</p>

  <p>Before commandments are given to humanity, YHVH demonstrates that righteousness begins with separation, obedience, and submission to His design. Shabbat emerges from Creation as a sacred boundary – not because YHVH was weary, but because rest itself was sanctified. By ceasing, YHVH teaches humanity to trust His provision rather than strive endlessly.</p>

  <p>Shabbat is therefore a weekly return to Creation order. It realigns us with the rhythm set from the beginning and restores clarity, peace, and purpose to those who dwell within its boundary.</p>

  <h3>💙 <strong>APPLICATION</strong></h3>
  <p> Shabbat invites us to examine whether our lives reflect the order of Creation or the chaos of unchecked striving. When boundaries are honored, peace follows. When they are ignored, confusion multiplies. This Shabbat calls us to rest intentionally, to trust fully, and to remember that we are creatures living within the wisdom of our Creator.</p>

  <h3>👐 <strong>CLOSING PRAYER</strong></h3>
  <p>YHVH, You who spoke light into existence and set time in motion, teach us to live within the order You established. Restore our alignment with Your design, quiet our restlessness, and renew our trust in You. May this Shabbat draw us back into the peace You sanctified from the beginning and prepare us to walk faithfully in the days ahead.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Rishon, Asiri 5, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Prayer as service of the heart</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“YHVH looks on the heart.”<br />
     - 1 Shemu’el (1 Samuel) 16:7</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>Prayer as the service of the heart is rooted in the mitzvah to approach YHVH with inner truth rather than outward form. Since YHVH looks upon the heart, prayer is not validated by posture, wording, or frequency, but by sincerity, humility, and alignment with His will. The heart is the place where intention is formed, where repentance is genuine, and where obedience is first accepted before it is lived out.</p>

  <p>To guard the heart, to purify motives, and to turn inwardly toward YHVH in truth is part of faithful service, ensuring that prayer is not separated from daily conduct but becomes the wellspring from which obedience flows.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>When prayer becomes the service of the heart, it removes performance and replaces it with honesty. The servant no longer prays to be heard by others or to satisfy habit, but to stand truthfully before YHVH. Such prayer reshapes the inner life, teaching attentiveness, humility, and readiness to obey, and draws the servant into deeper covenant faithfulness.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, search our hearts, purify our intentions, and teach us to draw near to You in truth so that our prayer may rise before You as faithful service.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h3><strong>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Sheni, Asiri 15, 6027 AA</strong></h3>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h4>⭐ THEME</h4>
  <p><strong>Levites Standing Between Wrath and the Camp</strong></p>

  <h4>📘 READING</h4>
  <p>“And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stopped.”<br />
    — Bemidbar (Numbers) 16:46–48</p>

  <h4>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h4>
  <p>Justice is not only the act of judging wrongdoing, but the responsibility to restrain further harm once judgment has begun. The Torah reveals that there are moments when delay itself becomes injustice, and when decisive intervention is required to preserve life.</p>

  <p>Those entrusted with authority are accountable not merely for identifying guilt, but for standing between destruction and the vulnerable. True justice steps into danger to halt escalation, choosing preservation over punishment and responsibility over self-protection.</p>

  <p>YHVH’s justice calls His servants to act as barriers against unchecked wrath — to intervene, to restore order, and to protect the camp even at personal cost.</p>

  <h4>🩵 REFLECTION</h4>
  <p>In this final desert justice moment, justice is not expressed through verdicts or penalties, but through courageous action. Aharon did not debate the cause of judgment — he ran into its path. He placed himself between wrath and the people, risking his life to stop what would otherwise continue unchecked.</p>

  <p>The Levites were not chosen for comfort, but for dangerous proximity. Their role was to stand where others could not, absorbing consequence so that the camp might live. This teaches that true justice does not always wait for perfect order; sometimes it intervenes to preserve life before order can be restored.</p>

  <p>Justice that hesitates when lives are at stake becomes injustice through delay.</p>

  <h4>👐 PRAYER</h4>
  <p>Avinu Malkeinu, teach us discernment to know when to intervene and courage to step into the breach. Guard our hearts from indifference, and shape us to reflect Your justice that protects life and restrains destruction.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

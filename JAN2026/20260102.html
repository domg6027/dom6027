  <h2>EREV SHABBAT DAVAR LECHEM – Asiri 12, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p><strong>Justice in Waiting — The Cloud That Chose When to Move</strong></p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“And at the commandment of YHVH the children of Yisrael journeyed, and at the commandment of YHVH they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. And when the cloud was taken up, then after that the children of Yisrael journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Yisrael encamped.”<br />
     — Bemidbar (Numbers) 9:18</p>

  <h3>🟫 FOCUS</h3>
  <p>In the wilderness, justice was not only expressed through judgments and rulings, but through restraint. Yisrael did not move when it was convenient, profitable, or urgent by human standards. They moved only when YHVH moved them.</p>

  <p>The cloud taught a form of desert justice that is often overlooked: the justice of waiting. No tribe could force progress. No leader could accelerate timing. No individual could claim priority. All were equal under the authority of YHVH’s presence.</p>

  <p>This protected the community from chaos, rivalry, and self-interest. Justice was preserved not by action, but by submission.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Waiting is one of the hardest expressions of righteousness. It exposes impatience, fear, and the desire to control outcomes. Yet YHVH established waiting as a safeguard of justice, ensuring that no one advanced at the expense of another.</p>

  <p>In the desert, righteousness was proven not by speed, but by faithfulness.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, teach us to wait upon You. Guard us from moving ahead of Your instruction or acting out of impatience. Give us hearts that trust Your timing, eyes that watch for Your direction, and obedience that remains steady even when the journey pauses. May we honor Your justice by moving only when You lead.</p>

  <p>We pray for peace in the Middle East, South Africa, and the world. Bring stability, righteousness, and divine intervention where conflict rises.</p>

  <p>We pray for end-time revival. Let hearts awaken and turn back to Your truth across the earth.</p>

  <p>We pray for the elderly, especially those suffering abuse or neglect. Surround them with protection, dignity, care, and comfort.</p>

  <p>We pray for the farmers, especially those in danger of attacks. Shield their lives, strengthen their hands, and bless their labor.</p>

  <p>We pray for evangelists across the world, especially where persecution is severe. Empower them with courage, safety, and supernatural doors of opportunity.</p>

  <p>We pray for ill people, especially those with cancer and new viral outbreaks. Stretch out Your healing hand and bring restoration and hope.</p>

  <p>We pray for the coming tribulation and the signs already appearing. Prepare our hearts with wisdom, endurance, and steadfast faith.</p>

  <p>We pray for our ministry, Derech Olam Ministries. Guide each step, open the right doors, and let Your favor rest upon the work.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

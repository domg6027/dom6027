  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Chamishi, Echad Asar 9, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Responsibility for one another</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“And YHVH Elohim said to Cain, ‘Where is Abel thy brother?’ And he said, ‘I know not, am I my brother’s keeper?’”<br />
     — Bereshit (Genesis) 4:9</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>Yisrael is not built on isolated individuals, but on shared covenantal responsibility. Each person is accountable not only for their own conduct, but for the wellbeing, faithfulness, and protection of their brother and sister.</p>

  <p>To turn away from another’s need is to deny the very structure of the covenant community.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Responsibility begins with awareness. We are called to see one another - not as interruptions or burdens, but as entrusted lives placed within our care. A community that bears one another’s burdens reflects the order and compassion of YHVH. Indifference fractures; responsibility restores.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, teach us to walk as faithful guardians of one another. Remove hardness of heart and replace it with covenantal compassion. Strengthen our community to reflect Your righteousness, truth, and care, that Your Name may be honored among us.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

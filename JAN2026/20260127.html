  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Shlishi, Echad Asar 7, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Separation from impurity</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“Depart, depart, go out from there; touch no unclean thing. Come out from the midst of her; be clean, you who bear the vessels of YHVH.”<br />
     - Yeshayahu (Isaiah) 52:11</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>Separation from impurity is a foundational mitzvah that calls the servant of YHVH to live with discernment, boundaries, and intentional holiness. Impurity is not limited to ritual uncleanness alone, but includes influences, practices, and patterns that dull spiritual sensitivity and draw the heart away from obedience. The call to separate is not withdrawal from responsibility, but conscious distinction in conduct, speech, and allegiance.</p>

  <p>To separate from impurity means to refuse mixture — to recognise what does not belong in the life set apart for YHVH and to remove it willingly. This mitzvah trains the servant to guard the inner life, to remain attentive to what is allowed to shape thought and desire, and to preserve the holiness entrusted to those who bear the Name of YHVH.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Separation sharpens spiritual clarity. When impurity is resisted, the heart becomes more responsive, and obedience more consistent. Through deliberate separation, the servant learns to walk lightly in the world without absorbing its corruption, remaining faithful to the calling to be set apart for YHVH’s purposes.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, give us discernment to recognise impurity, strength to separate from what does not honour You, and hearts committed to walking in holiness before You.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Shlishi, Asiri 23, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ <strong>THEMES</strong></h3>
  <p>Mercy of Elohim / Justice for the Vulnerable</p>

  <h3>📘 <strong>READING</strong></h3>
  <p>“YHVH, YHVH Elohim, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.”<br />
     – Exodus 34:6</p>

  <p>“He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.”<br />
     – Deuteronomy 10:18</p>

  <h3>🟫 <strong>MITZVOT FOCUS</strong></h3>
  <h4><em><strong>Mercy of Elohim</strong></em></h4>
  <p>The mercy of Elohim is not weakness – it is covenant strength. When YHVH reveals Himself as merciful and gracious, He declares that His rulership is governed by compassion and faithfulness. His mercy preserves the repentant, restores the broken, and restrains deserved judgment so that righteousness can be re-established. To walk in His mercy is to reflect His character, extending patience and forgiveness while remaining anchored in truth.</p>

  <p>Those who know Elohim cannot be cruel, indifferent, or hard-hearted. His mercy shapes how we judge others, how we speak, and how we correct. It keeps justice from becoming brutality and truth from becoming cold.</p>

  <h4><em><strong>Justice for the Vulnerable</strong></em></h4>
  <p>YHVH Himself stands as the defender of those with no earthly power. The fatherless, the widow, and the stranger are placed under His direct protection. This mitzvah demands that society does not measure value by status or strength but by covenant responsibility. True justice is not neutral – it actively protects the weak.</p>

  <p>To ignore the vulnerable is to oppose the nature of Elohim. To defend them is to walk in alignment with His throne. Justice for the vulnerable establishes moral order and reveals whether a people truly fear YHVH.</p>

  <h3>🩵 <strong>REFLECTION</strong></h3>
  <p>Mercy without justice becomes sentimentality. Justice without mercy becomes oppression. In YHVH, they are perfectly united.</p>

  <p>When we show mercy and defend the vulnerable, we do not merely obey commandments – we reveal the heart of the King.</p>

  <h3>👐 <strong>PRAYER</strong></h3>
  <p>YHVH, teach us to walk in Your mercy and to uphold Your justice. Soften our hearts toward the broken and strengthen our hands to defend the weak. Let our lives reflect Your compassion and Your righteousness in all things.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

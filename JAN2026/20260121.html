  <h2>🕯️ DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Revi’i, Echad Asar 1, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Guarding Speech and Conduct with Wisdom</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“He who guards his mouth preserves his soul, but he who opens wide his lips shall have destruction.”<br />
     – Mishlei (Proverbs) 13:3</p>

  <p>“Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers.”<br />
     – Ephesians 4:29</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>The mitzvah of guarding speech teaches that words are not neutral. Speech carries power to establish peace or provoke harm, to instruct or to mislead, to build trust or to destroy it. Torah wisdom calls for restraint, discernment, and accountability in what is spoken, especially when emotions, disagreement, or authority are involved.</p>

  <p>Wise conduct flows directly from guarded speech. When words are measured and truthful, actions follow in order. Careless speech, however, often leads to fractured relationships, false judgment, and unnecessary conflict. Faithful obedience requires that speech and behavior remain aligned with Torah principles rather than impulse or reaction.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Guarded speech reflects inner discipline. When words are chosen carefully, they become instruments of righteousness rather than sources of regret. This mitzvah reminds us that covenant faithfulness is demonstrated daily through how we speak, respond, and represent the Name we bear.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, set a guard over our mouths and establish wisdom within our hearts. Teach us to speak truth with humility and restraint, and to act with integrity in every situation. Let our words and conduct reflect Your Torah and bring peace rather than division.</p>

  <p>May this new month of Echad Asar be ordered by Your will. Renew our strength, sharpen our discernment, and establish our steps in obedience as we walk before You in faithfulness.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

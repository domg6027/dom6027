  <h2>🌟 SHABBAT MESSAGE – Asiri 13, 6027 AA 🌟</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>✨ THEME</h3>
  <p><strong>The Fire That Did Not Consume the Camp</strong></p>

  <h3>👐 OPENING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>Avinu Malkeinu, You are a consuming fire and yet full of mercy. As we enter Your Shabbat, quiet our hearts and draw us into Your presence. Teach us to understand Your justice, not as destruction, but as purification and protection for Your people.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h3>🍷 COMMUNION</h3>
  <p>On this Shabbat we remember that YHVH’s fire does not destroy those who dwell under His covering. We partake in remembrance that His covenant refines, corrects, and preserves life. As we share the cup, we proclaim that His judgments are righteous and His mercy endures forever.</p>

  <h3>📜 TORAH READING</h3>
  <p>“And the fire of YHVH burned among them, and consumed those in the uttermost parts of the camp. And the people cried unto Moshe; and when Moshe prayed unto YHVH, the fire was quenched.”<br />
     - Bemidbar (Numbers) 11:1–2</p>

  <h3>📖 MESSAGE</h3>
  <p>In the wilderness, YHVH revealed a form of justice that was both severe and restrained. His fire burned at the edges of the camp, not to annihilate Yisrael, but to correct them. The center was preserved. The camp endured.</p>

  <p>This desert moment teaches that YHVH’s justice is purposeful. It draws boundaries, exposes disorder, and calls the people back to alignment without destroying the covenant community. Where human justice often overreaches or collapses, YHVH’s justice remains measured and intentional.</p>

  <p>Shabbat reminds us that we live under that same protective justice. We rest not because there is no judgment, but because judgment belongs to YHVH alone. His fire corrects without consuming those who remain within His order.</p>

  <h3>💙 APPLICATION</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do I recognize correction as mercy rather than rejection?</li>
    <li>Do I remain within YHVH’s order when His justice exposes error?</li>
    <li>Does my Shabbat reflect trust in His righteous rule?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Let this Shabbat remind us that YHVH’s justice refines, guards, and preserves His people.</p>

  <h3>👐 CLOSING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, thank You that Your justice is faithful and restrained. Teach us to dwell within Your order, to receive correction with humility, and to trust that Your judgments are for our good. May this Shabbat strengthen our reverence, obedience, and rest in You.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

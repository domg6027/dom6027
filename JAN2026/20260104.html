  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Rishon, Asiri 14, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p><strong>Justice for the Uncounted</strong></p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“And the children of Yoseph spoke unto Moshe, saying, Why have you given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as YHVH has blessed me hitherto?”<br />
     - Yehoshua (Joshua) 17:14</p>

  <h3>🟫 FOCUS</h3>
  <p>In the wilderness journey toward inheritance, justice was tested not only by obedience, but by fairness in distribution. The tribes who appeared strong, numerous, or influential were not permitted to claim more simply because of their size. At the same time, those who were fewer or less visible were not to be overlooked.</p>

  <p>YHVH’s justice accounted for every household. Inheritance was not seized by strength, nor withheld by neglect. It was apportioned under divine authority, ensuring that no tribe advanced at the expense of another.</p>

  <p>This desert lesson teaches that justice includes attentiveness — seeing those who might otherwise be missed and ensuring that provision reaches every rightful place.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Justice is compromised when the loudest voices receive the greatest share. YHVH listens not only to those who speak boldly, but also to those who stand quietly within His order.</p>

  <p>True justice requires humility and restraint, not entitlement.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, teach us to walk in justice that reflects Your heart. Guard us from claiming more than what You have allotted, and open our eyes to those who are easily forgotten. May we honor Your order by seeking fairness, humility, and righteousness in all that we do.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

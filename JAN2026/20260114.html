  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Reviʽi, Asiri 23, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ <strong>THEMES</strong></h3>
  <p>Love of Elohim / Justice – Equality Before the Law</p>

  <h3>📘 <strong>READING</strong></h3>
  <p>“And thou shalt love YHVH thy Elohim with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.”<br>
     – Deuteronomy 6:5</p>

  <p>“Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.”<br>
     – Leviticus 19:15</p>

  <h3>🟫 <strong>MITZVOT FOCUS</strong></h3>
  <h4><em><strong>Love of Elohim</strong></em></h4>
  <p>The command to love YHVH with all our being is the foundation of covenant life. This love is not a feeling alone; it is a commitment of the heart, soul, and strength. To love Elohim means that every choice, every motive, and every allegiance is shaped by devotion to Him. It is total devotion, not partial preference. When we truly love Elohim, His ways become our greatest desire and His instructions our greatest joy.</p>

  <p>To embody the love of Elohim is to orient our lives around Him – placing His commands above personal comfort, His truth above cultural influence, and His glory above human acclaim. Love for Elohim transforms obedience from duty into delight.</p>

  <h4><em><strong>Justice – Equality Before the Law</strong></em></h4>
  <p>Justice that truly reflects Torah does not favor the powerful nor overlook the weak. The Torah forbids showing partiality, demanding that judges and leaders treat every person — rich or poor, famous or obscure – with equal respect and impartiality. True justice is blind not because it is indifferent, but because it is anchored in righteousness, not reputation or wealth.</p>

  <p>Equality before the law protects the vulnerable, honors the covenant, and manifests the character of Elohim in the life of a people. Where partiality prevails, trust is lost and righteousness is replaced with advantage. A community rooted in equality before the law reflects the heart of Elohim, who judges no person by status but by truth.</p>

  <h3>🩵 <strong>REFLECTION</strong></h3>
  <p>Love for Elohim fuels righteous justice. When our hearts are rightly ordered toward Him, we see others as He sees them – without bias, without favor, and without distortion. A people who love Elohim and seek equality before the law become a beacon of righteousness in a fractured world.</p>

  <h3><strong>PRAYER</strong></h3>
  <p>YHVH, teach us to love You with all that we are and all that we will be. Give us hearts that cherish Your commands and minds that uphold Your righteousness. Help us to judge without partiality and to reflect Your justice in every relationship and every decision.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

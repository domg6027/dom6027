  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM - Yom Sheni, Asiri 22, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ <strong>THEMES</strong></h3>
  <p>Unity of Elohim / Justice - Prohibition of Bribery</p>

  <h3>📘 <strong>READING</strong></h3>
  <p>“Hear, O Israel: YHVH our Elohim, YHVH is one.”<br />
     – Deuteronomy 6:4</p>

  <p>“Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.”<br />
     – Deuteronomy 16:19</p>

  <h3>🟫 <strong>MITZVOT FOCUS</strong></h3>

  <h4><em><strong>Unity of Elohim</strong></em></h4>
  <p>The mitzvah of the Unity of Elohim calls us to recognize that there is one YHVH — undivided in authority, unmatched in power, and supreme in sovereignty. This unity governs worship, loyalty, and obedience. To affirm His oneness is to reject divided hearts and mixed allegiances, placing every aspect of life under His rule.</p>

  <p>Living in the unity of Elohim produces spiritual integrity. When our devotion is undivided, our decisions become clear, our priorities align with Torah, and our witness remains consistent in a world of competing claims.</p>

  <h4><em><strong>Justice — Prohibition of Bribery</strong></em></h4>
  <p>The Torah forbids bribery because it corrupts judgment and undermines righteousness. When gifts or favors influence decisions, truth is displaced by advantage, and the innocent are placed at risk. Justice cannot survive where outcomes are bought.</p>

  <p>Refusing bribery protects the moral fabric of the community. It preserves fairness, defends the vulnerable, and honors the righteous standards of YHVH, who cannot be persuaded or swayed by gain.</p>

  <h3>🩵 <strong>REFLECTION</strong></h3>
  <p>Undivided devotion to the one Elohim leads to clean judgment. Where hearts are loyal to YHVH alone, truth is protected and justice stands firm.</p>

  <h3><strong>PRAYER</strong></h3>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, keep our hearts united to You alone. Guard us from partiality and from every form of corruption. May we walk in truth, judge with integrity, and reflect Your righteousness in all our ways.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

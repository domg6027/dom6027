  <p>“He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does YHVH require of you but to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your Elohim?”<br />
     – Michah 6:8</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <h4><strong><em>Justice that Protects the Vulnerable</em></strong></h4>
  <p>The Torah commands justice as an active responsibility, especially toward those who lack power, voice, or protection. Justice requires restraint, discernment, and courage; it demands that decisions be weighed according to Torah rather than convenience, reputation, or pressure.</p>

  <p>In doing so, justice becomes a safeguard for the weak and a testimony of faithfulness before Elohim.</p>

  <h4><strong><em>Faithfulness in Daily Obedience</em></strong></h4>
  <p>Faithfulness is proven not in moments of visibility, but in consistent obedience throughout ordinary life. The Torah teaches that covenant loyalty is expressed through honest conduct, disciplined choices, and perseverance even when no recognition follows.</p>

  <p>Faithfulness sustains justice by keeping obedience steady and uncompromised.</p>

  <h4><strong><em>Humility before Elohim</em></strong></h4>
  <p>Humility acknowledges human limitation and submits judgment, understanding, and desire to the authority of Torah. Without humility, justice becomes prideful and instruction becomes resisted.</p>

  <p>Humility teaches us to listen before speaking, to learn before correcting, and to yield before asserting.</p>

  <h4><strong><em>Reverence for Elders and Appointed Instruction</em></strong></h4>
  <p>Reverence for elders and teachers preserves covenant memory and communal stability. Those who have walked faithfully before us carry discernment shaped by obedience, endurance, and correction.</p>

  <p>To honor them is to recognize that Torah is transmitted through lived faithfulness, not merely through words.</p>

  <h3>🙏 PRAYERS</h3>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, we come before You as the day turns toward Shabbat. Search our hearts and reveal what must be corrected, restored, or released. Align our thoughts, words, and actions with Your Torah and establish peace within our dwellings.</p>

  <p>We pray for peace in Middle East, South Africa and the world. Send Your Shalom where there is strife and let striving parties stop their antagonizing.</p>

  <p>We pray for end-time revival. Let Your Ru’ach fall on the set-apart ones.</p>

  <p>We pray for the elderly, especially those subject to abuse and neglect. Heal and protect the vulnerable ones among us.</p>

  <p>We pray for the farmers, especially those in danger of attacks. Put a host of angels around every farm to protect them and their possessions, and bless every harvest and flock.</p>

  <p>We pray for people living in disaster-stricken areas. Protect Your set-apart ones and restore to those who have lost, more than what they have lost.</p>

  <p>We pray for evangelists all over the world, especially in those countries where they are persecuted. Protect each one of them with an angel who covers them with wings so the enemy cannot see them as they do Your work.</p>

  <p>We pray for ill people, especially those with cancer and new viral diseases that are spreading like wildfires. Heal them in Your great mercy.</p>

  <p>We pray for the coming tribulation, as the signs of the birth pains are here already. Prepare Your bride to be ready for the bridal supper of the Lamb.</p>

  <p>We pray also for our ministry (Derech Olam Ministries). Take this Word through the ethernet to places where it is needed.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

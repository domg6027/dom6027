  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – YOM REVI'I, ASIRI 17, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Justice Established Through Righteous Judgment</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which YHVH thy Elohim giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.”<br />
     – Devarim (Deuteronomy) 16:18</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>The mitzvot governing the judicial system establish YHVH as the ultimate source of justice. Judges are appointed not to rule by personal opinion, emotion, or advantage, but to apply Torah faithfully and without partiality. These laws prohibit bribery, favoritism, and corruption, ensuring that judgment reflects righteousness rather than power.</p>

  <p>The judicial mitzvot protect the community by restraining wrongdoing, defending the innocent, and preserving order. Justice is not reactive but structured, requiring integrity, accountability, and reverence for YHVH. Through these instructions, the Torah ensures that law serves truth and that authority remains bound to divine instruction.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>A community stands or falls on the integrity of its justice. When judgment is distorted, peace collapses and trust erodes. These mitzvot call us to consider whether our decisions, actions, and leadership reflect YHVH’s standard of righteousness.</p>

  <p>True justice is not harsh, nor is it weak. It is firm, impartial, and anchored in obedience. Where Torah governs judgment, stability and peace can endure.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH, Elohim of justice and truth, establish righteousness in our gates. Teach us to honor Your instruction in judgment and decision-making, to reject corruption and partiality, and to walk humbly before You. May Your justice guard our communities and Your truth guide all authority.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

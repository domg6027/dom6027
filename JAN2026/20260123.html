  <h2>🕯️ DAVAR LECHEM – Erev Shabbat, Echad Asar 3, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEMES</h3>
  <p>Preparing for Sacred Time / Faithfulness Expressed Through Order</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to YHVH your Elohim.”<br />
     – Shemot (Exodus) 20:9–10</p>

  <p>“Let all things be done decently and in order.”<br />
     – 1 Corinthians 14:40</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <h4><strong><em>Preparing for Sacred Time</em></strong></h4>
  <p>Erev Shabbat teaches that holiness is entered through preparation, not interruption. The Torah establishes that sacred time is approached intentionally, with forethought, discipline, and respect. Preparation orders the heart, aligns the household, and clears space for rest, teaching us that Shabbat is not an escape from life but a sanctified rhythm within it.</p>

  <p>By preparing before Shabbat begins, we affirm that obedience precedes rest. This mitzvah trains us to anticipate holiness, to settle unresolved matters, and to approach YHVH’s appointed time with readiness rather than haste. Preparation itself becomes an act of reverence and trust.</p>

  <h4><strong><em>Faithfulness Expressed Through Order</em></strong></h4>
  <p>Order is a visible expression of faithfulness. Torah order reflects submission to YHVH’s design rather than personal convenience or chaos. When life is ordered according to His instruction, peace is preserved and responsibilities are fulfilled without striving.</p>

  <p>Faithfulness through order guards against neglect and spiritual drift. It teaches that obedience is sustained through structure, consistency, and attentiveness. As Erev Shabbat draws near, order allows the transition from labor to rest to occur smoothly, honoring both work and sanctified time as gifts from YHVH.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Preparation and order work together to protect sacred time. When we prepare intentionally and live with disciplined faithfulness, Shabbat becomes a place of restoration rather than disruption. These mitzvot remind us that obedience shapes not only what we do, but how we transition between seasons of work and rest.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, as we prepare for Shabbat, order our hearts and our homes according to Your will. Teach us to honor sacred time through faithful preparation and disciplined living. Remove distraction, restore peace, and lead us into Your rest with gratitude and obedience.</p>

  <p>We pray for peace in the Middle East, South Africa, and the world, that YHVH would establish His Shalom where there is conflict, restrain violence, and bring an end to hostility and strife.</p>

  <p>We pray for end-time revival, that YHVH would pour out His Ru’ach upon His set-apart ones, awaken hearts to repentance, and restore obedience and faithfulness before Him.</p>

  <p>We pray for the elderly, especially those subject to abuse, neglect, or loneliness, that YHVH would protect them, strengthen them, and surround them with dignity and care.</p>

  <p>We pray for farmers and rural communities, especially those under threat of violence, that YHVH would place a hedge of protection around them, guard their lives and possessions, and bless their fields, flocks, and harvests.</p>

  <p>We pray for people living in disaster-stricken areas, that YHVH would shelter the vulnerable, provide relief, and restore to them more than what has been lost.</p>

  <p>We pray for evangelists and messengers of the Word throughout the world, especially where persecution is severe, that YHVH would protect them, grant wisdom, and conceal them from harm as they serve faithfully.</p>

  <p>We pray for the sick, especially those suffering from serious illness, cancer, and spreading diseases, that YHVH would bring healing, strength, and comfort in His great mercy.</p>

  <p>We pray for the coming tribulation, as the signs of birth pains are already evident, that YHVH would prepare His people, refine their faith, and ready His bride for what lies ahead.</p>

  <p>We pray for the work of the ministry and for the Word to go forth through every means available, that YHVH would carry His instruction to those who need it and establish His truth wherever it is received.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

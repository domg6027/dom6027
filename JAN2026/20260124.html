  <h2>🌟 SHABBAT MESSAGE – Echad Asar 4, 6027 AA 🌟</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>✨ THEME</h3>
  <p>Violence, Corruption, and Warning (Genesis 4–6)</p>

  <h3>👐 OPENING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, we come before You on this Shabbat seeking Your order, Your instruction, and Your peace. Set our hearts apart from the ways of corruption and violence, and establish within us a spirit that delights in obedience and truth. Teach us through Your Torah, and guard us as we rest in Your presence.</p>

  <h3>🍷 COMMUNION</h3>
  <p>As we set this time apart, we remember that covenant life is sustained through obedience and faithfulness. Shabbat reminds us that separation from corruption begins with choosing alignment with YHVH. May this sacred time renew our commitment to walk uprightly before Him in every generation.</p>

  <h3>📜 TORAH READING</h3>
  <p>“The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.”<br />
     - Genesis 4:10</p>

  <p>“The earth was corrupt before Elohim, and the earth was filled with violence.”<br />
     - Genesis 6:11</p>

  <p>“My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he is indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.”<br />
     - Genesis 6:3</p>

  <h3>📖 MESSAGE</h3>
  <h4><strong><em>Violence as the Fruit of Unchecked Sin</em></strong></h4>
  <p>From the moment Cain rose against his brother, Scripture reveals how sin, when left unrestrained, escalates into violence. Genesis 4 shows that YHVH warned Cain clearly, yet rejection of correction led to bloodshed. Violence is not sudden — it is the result of ignored instruction and hardened hearts.</p>

  <p>As generations progressed, violence became normalized. By the time of Noah, corruption filled the earth. This teaches us that when Torah boundaries are abandoned, society does not remain neutral — it decays. Shabbat calls us to pause and examine whether our choices cultivate righteousness or contribute to disorder.</p>

  <h4><strong><em>Corruption and the Collapse of Moral Order</em></strong></h4>
  <p>Genesis 6 reveals a world overwhelmed by corruption, where every intent of the heart was continually evil. This was not merely individual failure but systemic decay. When truth is distorted and authority is abused, corruption spreads unchecked.</p>

  <p>Torah instruction exists to preserve life, order, and justice. Shabbat stands as a weekly witness against corruption, reminding us that rest, obedience, and alignment with YHVH are acts of resistance against a broken world.</p>

  <h4><strong><em>Warning Before Judgment</em></strong></h4>
  <p>Before judgment came, YHVH issued warnings. Noah was given instruction, time, and purpose. This reflects YHVH’s mercy — He warns before He acts. Shabbat itself is a warning and a gift: a call to return, to realign, and to choose obedience before consequences arrive.</p>

  <p>This part of the message reminds us that covenant faithfulness is not passive. It requires listening, responding, and walking differently in a world that increasingly mirrors the days before the flood.</p>

  <h3>💙 APPLICATION</h3>
  <p>Shabbat invites us to step out of corruption and into covenant order. By guarding our choices, restraining violence in thought and action, and responding to YHVH’s warnings with humility, we become witnesses of righteousness in our generation. Obedience today preserves life tomorrow.</p>

  <h3>👐 CLOSING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Elohim, establish Your order within us. Guard us from violence, corruption, and hardened hearts. Teach us to heed Your warnings, to walk faithfully in Your instruction, and to remain set apart in a generation that drifts from truth. May this Shabbat strengthen us to choose life, righteousness, and obedience.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

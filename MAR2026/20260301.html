  <h2>🌾 DAVAR LECHEM - Schnein Asar 11, 6027 AA 🌾</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>✨ THEME</h3>
  <p>Prohibition of Gossip and Slander</p>

  <h3>📖 SCRIPTURES</h3>
  <p>“You shall not go up and down as a talebearer among your people…”<br>
     - Vayikra (Leviticus) 19:16</p>

  <p>“He who guards his mouth preserves his soul, but he who opens wide his lips shall have destruction.”<br>
     - Mishlei (Proverbs) 13:3</p>

  <h3>🪔 MESSAGE</h3>
  <p>Words carry weight. They can heal or they can wound, build or destroy. Gossip often disguises itself as concern, curiosity, or even “sharing information,” yet it quietly erodes trust and damages reputations. Slander goes further - it harms intentionally, distorting truth and planting seeds of division. The Torah instructs us clearly not to walk about as talebearers. This is not merely social advice; it is covenant instruction. A community rooted in righteousness cannot survive where words are uncontrolled.</p>

  <p>Silence can be holy. Restraint can be strength. When we guard our speech, we reflect the character of Elohim - faithful, truthful, and just.</p>

  <h3>💙 APPLICATION</h3>
  <p>Before speaking, we should ask:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is it true?</li>
    <li>Is it necessary?</li>
    <li>Is it righteous?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If not, wisdom calls us to hold our peace. Today, commit to guarding your tongue. Refuse to participate in conversations that diminish others. Choose words that bring life, encouragement, and integrity. Let your speech be aligned with covenant faithfulness.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH, set a guard over our mouths and keep watch over the door of our lips. Purify our speech, remove from us every impulse toward gossip or slander, and make our words instruments of truth and peace.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

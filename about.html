<h1>ABOUT US</h1>

<p><strong>Derech Olam Ministries Int'l</strong> is an online ministry adhering to the Torah and the original complete Bible.</p>

<hr>

<h1>WHAT DO WE BELIEVE?</h1>
<p>We believe:</p>

<ol>
  <li>God manifests as Father (YHVH – pronounced Yehuvah), Son (Yahusha HaMashiach), and Holy Spirit (Ru'ach HaQodesh). These are THREE distinct entities with ONE purpose. The Head is the Father (YHVH), and He alone is worshiped.</li>
  <li>The original scriptures, including the Apocrypha, are the highest authority.</li>
  <li>Baptism of believers is by immersion. Circumcision is required for all male believers, done on the 8th day for boys born to believers.</li>
  <li>The baptism of the Holy Spirit (Ru'ach HaQodesh) empowers believers to be witnesses.</li>
  <li>The Holy Spirit (Ru'ach HaQodesh) dwells within believers and equips them.</li>
  <li>The gifts of the Holy Spirit (Ru'ach HaQodesh) are active and valid today.</li>
  <li>The five-fold ministry (apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers) is for the perfecting of the saints.</li>
  <li>Prayer is a vital part of our walk with YHVH.</li>
  <li>Yahusha died on the STAKE and was resurrected by YHVH. His death replaced all animal offerings ordained by YHVH. The stake—not a cross—was the Roman method of execution.</li>
  <li>The End Times are unfolding as revealed in Scripture.</li>
  <li>Believers will participate in the resurrection, the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, and will receive rewards at the Bema Seat of Yahusha HaMashiach. Unbelievers face judgment according to Scripture.</li>
  <li>We retain the Jewish lifestyle and follow the original calendar recorded by Moses (Mosheh). The Torah contains commandments to be obeyed.</li>
  <li>We accept the Bible in its ORIGINAL form, including the Apocrypha and Tanakh.</li>
  <li>We follow the kosher diet ordained by YHVH.</li>
  <li>Married women should cover their heads during prayer as ordained; unmarried women may do so but are not required outside prayer.</li>
  <li>The Shabbat is a day of rest, ordained from creation. Fridays are preparation days. Biblical days begin and end at sunset.</li>
  <li>The new month is determined by crescent moon observation, with adjustments as prescribed, especially in Tishrei.</li>
  <li>Days and months are numbered according to Hebrew tradition, with occasional realignment months before Pesach.</li>
  <li>The creational calendar counts from Adam. We are in the year 6027 AA (After Adam), beginning nightfall March 30, 2025.</li>
</ol>

<h2>VISION</h2>
<p>To call people to accept Yahusha as the Messiah and Ben Elohim, and to serve YHVH by His instructions and commandments as detailed in the Torah.</p>

<hr>

<h2>MISSION</h2>
<p>To fulfill the commission given by Yahusha Messiah in Matthew 28:19–20 and related passages.</p>

<blockquote>
  So wherever you go, make disciples of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to do everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you until the end of time.
</blockquote>

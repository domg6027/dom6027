  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM — EREV SHABBAT, TISHI'I 21, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p> Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>📖 Today’s Mitzvot Focus</h3>
  <p>As Shabbat will begin tonight, we reflect on the mitzvot concerning the treatment of slaves. A Hebrew bondsman serves six years and must be released in the seventh with generosity to preserve dignity and hope. A runaway slave must not be returned to oppression, and no slave may be humiliated. These commands stand as reminders that every human being bears the imprint of YHVH, turning power into accountability and authority into compassion.</p>

  <h3>🕯 Message</h3>
  <p>As Shabbat will begin tonight, the mitzvot concerning servants, both Hebrew and foreign, confront us with a profound revelation of YHVH’s heart. These commands were never about enforcing hierarchy; they were designed to restrain power, uplift the vulnerable, and ensure that no human being in Yisrael’s camp could be treated as mere property. This is the essence of compassion, justice, humility, and honor.</p>

  <p>For the gentile servant, the Torah demands restraint and reverence: “You shall not rule with harshness.” Power must never be used to crush. Authority must never be used to humiliate. Even where the nations practiced cruelty, YHVH commanded His people to walk in compassion and fear of Him because all authority is borrowed, and all humans bear His image.</p>

  <p>For the runaway slave, YHVH established a radical command: do not return him, do not oppress him, let him live freely among you. This mitzvah was unheard of in any ancient culture and showed that YHVH defends the oppressed, breaks unjust chains, and places mercy above social systems.</p>

  <p>And the command to never humiliate a servant pierces directly to the heart. Humiliation is violence of the spirit, a sin against the image of Elohim in another. To shame someone under your authority is to forget that we were once slaves in Mitsrayim, and only compassion brought us out.</p>

  <h3>🔎 Reflection</h3>
  <p>Power must be used gently, never harshly.<br />
     YHVH protects the oppressed; so must we.<br />
     Honor is a Torah requirement; humiliation is a Torah violation.<br />
     Our past redemption shapes how we treat others.<br />
     True authority imitates the mercy of the One on the throne.</p>

  <p>Let every act of rest tonight rise from a heart aligned with YHVH’s mercy. Let our homes become sanctuaries of gentleness, peace, and compassion. Let harshness fall away as the light of Shabbat enters in.</p>

  <h3>🙏 Prayer</h3>
  <p>YHVH, draw us into Your rest as the sun sets and Shabbat begins this evening. Cleanse our hearts, renew our minds, and anchor us in Your peace.</p>

  <p>We pray for peace in the Middle East, South Africa, and the world. Bring stability and calm where fear and conflict have taken hold.<br />
     We pray for end-time revival. Stir hearts worldwide to return to truth and to seek Your ways.<br />
     We pray for the elderly, especially those suffering abuse or neglect. Surround them with protection, dignity, and care.<br />
     We pray for the farmers, especially those facing danger. Guard their lives, bless their fields, and strengthen their families.<br />
     We pray for evangelists across the world, especially in nations where they face persecution. Give them courage, provision, and open doors.<br />
     We pray for the ill, especially those with cancer or fast-spreading new diseases. Stretch out Your healing hand and bring relief.<br />
     We pray concerning the coming tribulation and the signs already visible. Prepare our hearts and steady our faith.<br />
     We pray for our ministry, Derech Olam Ministries. Guide each step, open the right doors, and let Your favor rest upon the work.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – TISHI'I 17, 6027 AA</h2>

  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>🌟 THEME</h3>
  <p>A DESERT INCIDENT: MOSHE’S ARMS HELD UP IN BATTLE</p>

  <h3>📖 Torah Reading</h3>
  <p>“And it came to be, when Moshe held up his hand, that Yisrael prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed… But Aharon and Hur supported his hands…”<br />
     - Shemot 17:11–12</p>

  <h3>✨ Message</h3>
  <p>As Amalek attacked Israel without warning, the conflict revealed a deeper truth than the battlefield could show. Moshe stood upon the hill, hands raised toward the heavens - a posture of dependence, intercession, and alignment with YHVH. Yet even Moshe grew weary. His strength faltered, and the people’s victory wavered with it.</p>

  <p>What transformed the moment was not Moshe’s ability, but the unity around him. Aharon and Hur stepped in, not to replace Moshe, but to uphold him. Together they created stability where exhaustion threatened collapse. The victory over Amalek was won not by individual strength, but by shared faithfulness - a community standing together under YHVH’s banner.</p>

  <p>This desert incident teaches that even the strongest among us grow tired, and that weariness is not failure. YHVH designed His people to uphold one another. Leadership is strengthened, not diminished, when others step in to support. The camp moves forward in victory when hearts are united, hands are lifted together, and no one stands alone.</p>

  <h3>📖 Reflection</h3>
  <p>“Two are better than one… for if one falls, the other lifts up his companion.”<br />
     - Qohelet 4:9–10</p>

  <h3>🩵 Application and Mitzvot</h3>
  <p>Today’s focus is supporting one another in times of weakness. Reflect:</p>

  <p>– Who in my life needs their “arms” upheld today?<br />
     – Am I willing to receive help when I grow weary?<br />
     – Do my actions strengthen the camp, or do they leave others to struggle alone?</p>

  <p>Offering support to someone who is tired becomes a mitzvah that strengthens the whole assembly.</p>

  <h3>🙌 Prayer</h3>
  <p>Abba YHVH, teach us to stand together in unity. Help us recognize when others need support and give us humility to accept help when we are weary. Strengthen our hands, steady our hearts, and let our unity be a testimony to Your Name. May we walk together under Your banner, trusting Your guidance in every battle.</p>

  <p>Baruch YHVH.</p>

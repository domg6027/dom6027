  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – TISHI'I 20, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>🌟 THEME</h3>
  <p>Mitzvot Concerning the Hebrew Bondsman and Maidservant</p>

  <h3>📖 READING</h3>
    <p>“Do not send him away empty-handed.”<br />
    - Devarim 15:13</p>

    <p>“If a man sells his daughter as a maidservant, she is not to go out as the male servants do.”<br />
    - Shemot 21:7</p>

    <p>“She is to be redeemed… he has no authority to sell her to a foreign people.”<br />
    - Shemot 21:8</p>

  <h3>✨ MESSAGE</h3>
  <p>The Torah’s instructions for the Hebrew bondsman and maidservant stand as a testimony to justice, compassion, and protection. These commandments were never designed to create social hierarchy, but to preserve dignity in moments of economic hardship.</p>

    <p>When a Hebrew bondsman completed his service, YHVH commanded that he be sent out with blessing. He was not to start again from nothing, nor be pushed back toward poverty. Freedom must be paired with provision — a reflection of how YHVH brought us out of Mitsrayim with favor, not scarcity.</p>

    <p>The maidservant, too, was guarded by strict boundaries. She could be redeemed. She could be taken in marriage. She could not be exploited, mistreated, or sold to others. In a world where the vulnerable were often discarded, YHVH placed a hedge of protection around her — reminding the camp that value is not measured by circumstance.</p>

    <p>These mitzvot teach us the heart of the Father: He restores, not exploits. He lifts, not burdens. He guards the weak and limits the power of the strong. In His kingdom, “servant” never meant “lesser.” Each life remains precious — marked by His Name and redeemed for His purpose.</p>

  <h3>📖 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>- Provision is part of restoration — freedom without support is not freedom.<br />
     - YHVH defends the vulnerable; we must do the same.<br />
     - Commitment in a household must reflect honor and compassion.<br />
     - Redemption is always possible — He never leaves anyone without a way back.</p>

  <h3>🙌 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>Abba YHVH, teach us to see others as You see them — with worth, dignity, and honor. Shape our character so that we restore and uplift rather than burden. Help us walk in compassion, justice, and the spirit of Your mitzvot. Let our homes and actions reflect Your heart toward the weak and the redeemed.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

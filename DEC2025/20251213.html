  <h2>🌟 SHABBAT MESSAGE - TISHI’I 22, 6027 AA 🌟</h2>

  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>✨ THEME</h3>
  <p><strong>The Shabbat of the Ingathering - When Every Exile Will Return</strong></p>

  <h3>👐 OPENING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>Blessed are You, YHVH our Elohim, who sanctifies the seventh day and calls His people into rest. As we enter this Shabbat, gather our hearts, quiet our striving, and draw us back into Your presence. Teach us to dwell in Your rest as a people who belong to You.</p>

  <p>Baruch YHVH.</p>

  <h3>🍷 COMMUNION</h3>
  <p>As we set apart this Shabbat, we remember that rest itself is a gift from YHVH. In ceasing, we testify that our lives are sustained not by our labor alone, but by His faithfulness. This day reminds us that we are invited guests at His table, returning again to the place prepared for us.</p>

  <h3>📜 TORAH READING</h3>
  <p>“YHVH your Elohim will gather you again from all the peoples where YHVH your Elohim has scattered you.”<br />
    - Devarim (Deuteronomy) 30:3</p>

  <h3>📖 MESSAGE</h3>
  <p>Shabbat is more than a pause in time - it is a return.</p>

  <p>From the beginning, Shabbat was given as a dwelling place, a sanctified home within time where wandering ceases and identity is restored. Each week, YHVH gathers His people from the scattered fragments of labor, concern, and distraction, and calls them back into His presence.</p>

  <p>The Torah speaks of a future Ingathering, when YHVH will gather His dispersed people from the four corners of the earth. The exiles will return, divisions will be healed, and the people will stand as one under His reign. That promise lies ahead, yet Shabbat allows us to taste it now.</p>

  <p>Every Shabbat is a small rehearsal of that greater return. We step out of dispersion and into unity. We remember who we are and to whom we belong. Rest is not withdrawal from purpose - it is restoration of it.</p>

  <p>The final Ingathering will not only bring bodies home, but identities. Shabbat teaches us that belonging begins not with movement, but with dwelling - dwelling in trust, obedience, and covenant. As we keep Shabbat, we practice living as a gathered people even while the world remains scattered.</p>

  <h3>💙 APPLICATION</h3>
  <p>Consider where “exile” still shows itself in your life - not of location, but of heart, focus, or identity. Allow Shabbat to draw you back. Let this day realign you with who you are as part of YHVH’s people, and strengthen your hope in the promised Ingathering still to come.</p>

  <h3>👐 CLOSING PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH, gather us as You have promised. Restore what has been scattered and heal what has been divided. As we rest before You on this Shabbat, anchor us in our identity and teach us to live as a people who are already returning home.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

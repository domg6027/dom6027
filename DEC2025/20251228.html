  <h3>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Rishon Asiri 7, 6027 AA</h3>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h4>⭐ THEME</h4>
  <p>Victory Through Upholding Faith</p>

  <h4>📘 READING</h4>
  <p>“And it came to pass, when Moshe held up his hand, that Yisrael prevailed:<br />
     and when he let down his hand, Amaleq prevailed.<br />
     But Moshe’s hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him,<br />
     and he sat thereon; and Aharon and Chur stayed up his hands,<br />
     the one on the one side, and the other on the other side;<br />
     and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.<br />
     And Yehoshua discomfited Amaleq and his people with the edge of the sword.”<br />
     — Shemot (Exodus) 17:11–13</em></p>

  <h4>🟫 FOCUS</h4>
  <p>This day in Yisrael's history teaches that victory does not come from strength, numbers, or weapons, but from faithfulness to YHVH sustained over time. Moshe’s raised hands represented dependence on YHVH, and when his strength failed, the people did not abandon him — they supported him. The battle was won not by individual effort, but by unity, endurance, and shared responsibility before YHVH.</p>

  <h4>🩵 REFLECTION</h4>
  <p>Moshe could not hold his arms up alone. Leadership required support, and faith required perseverance. When his hands dropped, the people faltered; when they were upheld, victory followed. This reveals a vital truth: obedience must be sustained, and no one is meant to stand alone.</p>

  <p><strong>Ask yourself today:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do I support those who lead in faith, or do I expect them to stand without help?</li>
    <li>Do I remain steadfast when obedience becomes tiring?</li>
    <li>Do I recognize that my faithfulness affects the outcome for others?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>YHVH designed victory to flow through unity, humility, and shared trust in Him.</p>

  <h4>👐 PRAYER</h4>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, teach us to stand together in obedience. Strengthen our hands when they grow weary, and give us hearts willing to support one another in faithfulness. May we remember that victory comes from You alone, and may our trust remain steady until the task is complete.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

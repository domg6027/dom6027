  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – YOM REVI'I TISHI'I 26, 6027 AA</h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Justice, Compassion, and Trust in Daily Conduct</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“When a man borrows anything from his neighbor, and it is injured or dies while its owner is not with it, he shall surely make restitution.”<br />
     – Shemot (Exodus) 22:14</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>Borrowing in Torah is never a casual act; it creates a binding responsibility before YHVH. The borrower accepts temporary use of what belongs to another and is therefore obligated to guard it with the same care as their own property. Negligence, misuse, or indifference transforms borrowing into concealed wrongdoing, even without intent to steal.</p>

  <p>The Torah establishes that trust is sacred. One who borrows must remain mindful that loss, damage, or delay in return affects another person’s livelihood and peace. Borrowing demands honesty, restraint, and accountability, teaching that righteousness is measured not only by what we own, but by how we handle what is entrusted to us.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Borrowing reveals the condition of the heart. When something does not belong to us, our choices expose whether we walk in integrity or convenience. Torah does not measure righteousness only by what we refrain from taking, but by how faithfully we guard what is placed temporarily in our hands.</p>

  <p>This mitzvah teaches us to slow down and remain mindful of responsibility. Carelessness with borrowed things communicates disregard for the trust extended by another. Faithfulness, however, honors both the lender and YHVH, who sees every act of stewardship. In this way, borrowing becomes a training ground for honesty, self-discipline, and reverence for what is not our own.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Eloheinu, teach us to walk in justice and faithfulness in all our dealings. Guard our hearts from carelessness and misuse of what is entrusted to us. Help us honor those who extend trust, and shape us into people who reflect Your righteousness in every detail of daily life.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

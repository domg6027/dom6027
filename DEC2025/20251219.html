  <h2>📨 <strong>EREV SHABBAT – DAVAR LECHEM – TISHI'I 28, 6027 AA</strong></h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>🌟 THEME</h3>
  <p>Lending with Compassion and Guarding the Dignity of the Needy</p>

  <h3>📖 READING</h3>
  <p>“If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, you shall not be to him as a creditor; you shall not press him for payment.”<br />
     – Shemot (Exodus) 22:25</p>

  <h3>✨ MESSAGE</h3>
  <p>As Shabbat approaches, Torah directs our hearts toward mercy and restraint in matters of lending. Lending to a brother in need is not a transaction of power, but an act of responsibility before YHVH. The lender is warned not to become oppressive, nor to demand payment in a way that crushes the spirit of the destitute.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Torah distinguishes between covenantal compassion within Israel and lawful collection from foreigners, teaching discernment without cruelty. These mitzvot establish a balance between justice and mercy, ensuring that financial dealings never eclipse human dignity.</p>

  <h3>📖 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Erev Shabbat invites us to lay down the impulse to control and to remember that provision comes from YHVH alone. Lending with compassion trains us to see the borrower not as a liability, but as a fellow bearer of need and hope. By refraining from pressing the poor, we mirror the patience and kindness YHVH extends to us daily.</p>

  <h3>🙌 EREV SHABBAT PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Eloheinu, as we prepare to enter Your Shabbat, soften our hearts and align our ways with Your righteousness. Teach us to lend generously, to refrain from oppression, and to act with wisdom and mercy in all financial matters.</p>

  <p>We pray for peace in the Middle East, South Africa, and the world. Bring stability, righteousness, and divine intervention where conflict rises.</p>

  <p>We pray for end-time revival. Let hearts awaken and turn back to Your truth across the earth.</p>

  <p>We pray for the elderly, especially those suffering abuse or neglect. Surround them with protection, dignity, care, and comfort.</p>

  <p>We pray for the farmers, especially those in danger of attacks. Shield their lives, strengthen their hands, and bless their labor.</p>

  <p>We pray for evangelists across the world, especially where persecution is severe. Empower them with courage, safety, and supernatural doors of opportunity.</p>

  <p>We pray for ill people, especially those with cancer and new viral outbreaks. Stretch out Your healing hand and bring restoration and hope.</p>

  <p>We pray for the coming tribulation and the signs already appearing. Prepare our hearts with wisdom, endurance, and steadfast faith.</p>

  <p>We pray for our ministry, Derech Olam Ministries. Guide each step, open the right doors, and let Your favor rest upon the work.</p>

  <p>We pray for the family members who lost loved ones in the Hanukkah attacks in Australia. Comfort the brokenhearted, surround them with Your nearness, and uphold them with peace and justice.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

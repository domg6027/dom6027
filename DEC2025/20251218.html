  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>If a fire breaks out and spreads to thorns, so that stacked grain, standing grain, or the field is consumed, the one who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.<br />
     - Shemot (Exodus) 22:6</p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>The unpaid watchman accepts responsibility not through payment, but through trust. Torah teaches that when a person freely agrees to guard what belongs to another, they assume accountability appropriate to that role. Even without wages, negligence is not excused. The unpaid watchman must act with care, vigilance, and honesty, recognizing that responsibility arises from agreement, not compensation.</p>

  <p>This mitzvah establishes that moral obligation is not diminished by generosity. Trust is safeguarded by attentiveness, and stewardship is measured by conduct, not reward.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>This mitzvah draws our attention to quiet forms of responsibility. The unpaid watchman reflects the kind of faithfulness that often goes unseen — service rendered without immediate benefit. Torah reminds us that willingness does not cancel duty, and kindness does not remove accountability.</p>

  <p>By honoring what we guard freely, we train our hearts to serve with integrity. In doing so, we prepare ourselves to carry greater responsibility without complaint, knowing that YHVH weighs faithfulness, not payment.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH Eloheinu, teach us to guard what is entrusted to us with diligence and truth. Shape our hearts to serve faithfully whether seen or unseen, rewarded or unrewarded. Prepare us to walk in responsibility, honoring trust and reflecting Your righteousness in all we are given to keep.</p>

  <p>Shalom until tomorrow.</p>

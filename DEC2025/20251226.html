  <h3>📨 EREV SHABBAT – DAVAR LECHEM – Asiri 5, 6027 AA</h3>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h4>🌟 THEME</h4>
  <p>Loans to Gentiles – Boundaries, Purpose, and Covenant Integrity</p>

  <h4>📖 READING</h4>
  <p>“You do not lend your brother interest, interest on silver, interest on food, interest on whatever is lent on interest. To a foreigner you lend interest, but to your brother you do not lend interest, so that YHVH your Elohim bless you in all that you set your hand to in the land which you are entering to possess.”<br />
     — Devarim (Deuteronomy) 23:19–20</p>

  <p>“If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, you do not act as a creditor to him; you do not lay interest on him.”<br />
     — Shemot (Exodus) 22:25</p>

  <h4>✨ MESSAGE</h4>
  <p>The Torah makes a deliberate distinction between lending within the covenant community and lending outside of it. Among YHVH’s people, lending is an expression of responsibility, mercy, and mutual preservation. It is never meant to become a tool for profit or control.</p>

  <p>With gentiles, however, the Torah permits interest—not as an encouragement toward exploitation, but as a boundary marker. Covenant relationships operate on a different moral economy. Israel is called to embody a model of trust, restraint, and shared accountability that reflects YHVH’s character.</p>

  <p>Even when interest is permitted toward outsiders, it is not unrestrained. Torah ethics still prohibit cruelty, deception, or oppression. The permission does not cancel righteousness; it reinforces distinction. YHVH’s people must never import exploitative systems into covenant life, nor allow financial interaction to erode holiness.</p>

  <h4>📖 REFLECTION</h4>
  <p>These mitzvot invite us to examine how deeply covenant values shape our thinking. Do we instinctively apply the world’s economic logic everywhere, or do we recognize where Torah draws sacred boundaries?</p>

  <p>The distinction in lending reminds us that obedience is not about uniform rules, but about faithfulness to YHVH’s design. Shabbat itself is a declaration that life is not sustained by relentless gain, but by trust and obedience.</p>

  <p>As we prepare to rest, we are reminded that provision flows from alignment with YHVH’s instructions, not from maximizing advantage.</p>

  <h4>🙌 EREV SHABBAT PRAYER</h4>
  <p>Avinu Malkeinu, we thank You for Your Torah that orders life with wisdom, justice, and mercy. As we enter Shabbat, settle our hearts into trust and rest. Teach us to live by covenant values and to honor the distinctions You have established.</p>

  <p>We pray for peace in the Middle East, South Africa, and the world. Bring stability, righteousness, and divine intervention where conflict rises.</p>

  <p>We pray for end-time revival. Let hearts awaken and turn back to Your truth across the earth.</p>

  <p>We pray for the elderly, especially those suffering abuse or neglect. Surround them with protection, dignity, care, and comfort.</p>

  <p>We pray for the farmers, especially those in danger of attacks. Shield their lives, strengthen their hands, and bless their labor.</p>

  <p>We pray for evangelists across the world, especially where persecution is severe. Empower them with courage, safety, and supernatural doors of opportunity.</p>

  <p>We pray for ill people, especially those with cancer and new viral outbreaks. Stretch out Your healing hand and bring restoration and hope.</p>

  <p>We pray for the coming tribulation and the signs already appearing. Prepare our hearts with wisdom, endurance, and steadfast faith.</p>

  <p>We pray for our ministry, Derech Olam Ministries. Guide each step, open the right doors, and let Your favor rest upon the work.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h3>🌟 SHABBAT MESSAGE – Asiri 6, 6027 AA 🌟</h3>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h4>✨ THEME</h4>
  <p>The Living Waters of the New Creation (Ḥazon / Revelation 21–22)</p>

  <h4>👐 OPENING PRAYER</h4>
  <p>Avinu Malkeinu, You are the Beginning and the End, the Source of all life. As we enter Your Shabbat, cleanse us from the dust of the week and draw us near to You. Let our hearts be opened to receive the living waters You freely give, that we may live before You in faithfulness and truth.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h4>🍷 COMMUNION</h4>
  <p>On this Shabbat we remember the Lamb who makes all things new. We partake in remembrance of the covenant and the promise of restoration. As the cup is shared, we proclaim the hope of the coming kingdom, where life flows unhindered from the throne of Elohim, and His people dwell with Him forever.</p>

  <h4>📜 TORAH READING</h4>
  <p>“And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away;<br />
    and there was no more sea. And I, Yohanan, saw the holy city, New Yerushalayim,<br />
    coming down from Elohim out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<br />
    And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the dwelling of Elohim is with men,<br />
    and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people,<br />
    and Elohim Himself shall be with them, and be their Elohim.<br />
    And Elohim shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;<br />
    and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,<br />
    neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.”<br />
    – Ḥazon (Revelation) 21:1–4</p>

  <p>“And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,<br />
    proceeding out of the throne of Elohim and of the Lamb.<br />
    In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river,<br />
    was the tree of life, which bore twelve kinds of fruit,<br />
    and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.<br />
    And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of Elohim and of the Lamb shall be in it;<br />
    and His servants shall serve Him: And they shall see His face;<br />
    and His name shall be in their foreheads.<br />
    And there shall be no night there; and they need no lamp,<br />
    neither light of the sun; for YHVH Elohim gives them light:<br />
    and they shall reign forever and ever…<br />
    And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.<br />
    And let him that hears say, Come.<br />
    And let him that is thirsty come.<br />
    And whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely.”<br />
    – Ḥazon (Revelation) 22:1–5, 17</p>

  <h4>📖 MESSAGE</h4>
  <p>Ḥazon reveals the destination of all covenant history: a renewed creation where YHVH dwells openly with His people. At the heart of this restored world flows the river of the water of life - pure, clear, and unending — proceeding directly from the throne.</p>

  <p>This living water is not earned, purchased, or controlled. It is given. It restores what was broken, heals what was corrupted, and sustains life without decay. Where this river flows, there is no curse, no darkness, and no death.</p>

  <p>Shabbat is a weekly rehearsal of this future reality. As we cease from our labor, we declare that life does not come from striving, but from YHVH alone. Shabbat teaches us how to drink from the living waters now - through trust, obedience, and dwelling in His presence.</p>

  <p>Those who wash their robes, who walk in His ways, are promised access to the tree of life. Shabbat aligns us with that promise and trains us to live as citizens of the coming New Yerushalayim.</p>

  <h4>💙 APPLICATION</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Are you truly thirsting for the life that comes from YHVH alone?</li>
    <li>Does your Shabbat reflect trust in His provision and rule?</li>
    <li>Are you living today as one preparing to dwell where the river of life flows?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Let this Shabbat renew your thirst for what is eternal.</p>

  <h4>👐 CLOSING PRAYER</h4>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, thank You for the promise of living waters and a restored creation. Teach us to walk in Your ways, to wash our robes, and to thirst only for what comes from You. May this Shabbat strengthen our hope and prepare us for the world to come.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

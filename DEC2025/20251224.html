  <h3>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Revi'i, Asiri 3, 6027 AA</h3>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h4>⭐ THEME</h4>
  <p>Safeguarding the Vulnerable – Prohibitions on Widow’s Collateral and Interest on Loans</p>

  <h4>📘 READING</h4>
  <p>“You do not take a widow’s garment as a pledge.”<br />
     — Devarim (Deuteronomy) 24:17, Yah Scriptures
  </p>

  <p>“If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, you do not act as a creditor to him; you do not lay interest on him.”<br />
     — Shemot (Exodus) 22:25, Yah Scriptures</p>

  <p>“You do not lend your brother interest — interest on silver, interest on food, interest on whatever is lent on interest.”<br />
     — Devarim (Deuteronomy) 23:19</p>

  <h4>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h4>
  <p>The Torah draws an unmistakable boundary around those most vulnerable to exploitation. A widow, lacking the protection of household provision, may never be pressed through collateral. Likewise, lending within the covenant is forbidden to become a means of profit through interest.</p>

  <p>These mitzvot establish that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Vulnerability removes any moral claim to collateral.</li>
    <li>Lending to the poor is an act of support, not commerce.</li>
    <li>Interest transforms help into domination.</li>
    <li>YHVH personally identifies with those exposed to economic pressure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Torah does not outlaw responsibility or repayment, but it absolutely forbids profiting from another’s weakness. Justice, in YHVH’s eyes, is measured by protection, not leverage.</p>

  <h4>🩵 REFLECTION</h4>
  <p>These commands expose the heart behind financial dealings. When resources are uneven, Torah demands restraint from the one with power. A widow cannot absorb loss the same way others can — therefore the Torah intervenes decisively.</p>

  <p>Interest, too, reveals motive. What appears reasonable by human economics is declared unrighteous by covenant law when it feeds on necessity. YHVH’s people are called to preserve life and dignity, not to multiply gain through another’s distress.</p>

  <p>These mitzvot challenge us to examine whether our sense of fairness is shaped by Torah or by custom. True obedience is not proven by generosity alone, but by refusing advantage when it is available.</p>

  <h4>👐 PRAYER</h4>
  <p>Avinu Malkeinu, You are the Defender of the widow and the Judge of every transaction. Teach us to handle resources with fear of You and compassion for others. Remove from us every desire to profit from vulnerability, and train our hearts to reflect Your justice and mercy.</p>

  <p>Establish our ways in righteousness and integrity. Let our lending, our giving, and our decisions honor Your Torah. Guard the vulnerable through our obedience, and let this month bear fruit that is upright and pleasing in Your sight.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

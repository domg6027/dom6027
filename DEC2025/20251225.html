  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p><strong>Lending and Borrowing with Interest – Why Both Are Forbidden in Torah</strong></p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“You do not lend your brother interest – interest on silver, interest on food, interest on whatever is lent on interest.”<br>
       - Devarim (Deuteronomy) 23:19</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, you do not act as a creditor to him; you do not lay interest on him.”<br>
       - Shemot (Exodus) 22:25</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“He who does not put out his silver at interest, and does not take a bribe against the innocent… he who does these shall never be moved.”<br>
       - Tehillim (Psalms) 15:5</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>The Torah forbids interest not only to restrain the lender, but also to protect the borrower from participating in a system that corrupts covenant relationships. Interest transforms assistance into exploitation and mutual responsibility into hierarchy and dependence.</p>

  <p>These mitzvot teach that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lending among YHVH’s people is an act of support, not profit.</li>
    <li>Borrowing with interest legitimizes oppression and imbalance.</li>
    <li>Interest feeds on time, pressure, and vulnerability.</li>
    <li>Covenant community is preserved by trust, not financial leverage.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By forbidding both giving and receiving interest, the Torah dismantles a cycle that would otherwise normalize gain from another’s necessity. Economic interaction is subordinated to righteousness, not efficiency.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>Interest appears harmless when viewed through worldly systems, yet Torah exposes its deeper effect: it quietly shifts trust away from YHVH and toward mechanisms of control. Over time, it erodes brotherhood and replaces compassion with calculation.</p>

  <p>These mitzvot call us to examine whether our financial assumptions are shaped by covenant or by culture. True obedience may require refusing arrangements that appear normal or advantageous but contradict Torah values. Faithfulness is revealed when we accept limitation for the sake of righteousness.</p>

  <p>A people who trust YHVH do not require interest to feel secure. They rely on provision, restraint, and mutual responsibility established by His instructions.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>Avinu Malkeinu, You are the Provider and Sustainer of Your people. Teach us to handle resources with faith, not fear. Remove from us the desire to profit from time, pressure, or necessity, and shape our hearts to walk in trust, restraint, and compassion.</p>

  <p>Establish our ways in covenant faithfulness. Align our understanding, our decisions, and our dealings with Your Torah. Let this month train us to trust You more deeply, that our lives may reflect righteousness and unity among Your people.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

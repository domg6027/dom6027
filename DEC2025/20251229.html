  <h3>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Sheni Asiri 8, 6027 AA</h3>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h4>⭐ THEME</h4>
  <p>Upholding Lawful Claims with Integrity</p>

  <h4>📘 READING</h4>
  <p>“If a man delivers unto his neighbor money or vessels to keep,<br />
     and it is stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be found,<br />
     let him pay double. If the thief be not found,<br />
     then the master of the house shall be brought before the judges,<br />
     to see whether he has put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods.”<br />
     — Shemot (Exodus) 22:7–8</p>

  <h4>🟫 FOCUS</h4>
  <p>The Torah establishes that lawful claims must be handled with truth, restraint, and accountability. A claim is not validated by emotion, force, or assumption, but by righteousness and order before YHVH. Responsibility is clearly defined: ownership, guardianship, and loss are not blurred, and justice is pursued without exploitation or deceit.</p>

  <p>Lawful claims protect both the one who seeks restitution and the one who stands accused. They prevent chaos, abuse, and false gain, ensuring that disputes are resolved under authority rather than personal power.</p>

  <h4>🩵 REFLECTION</h4>
  <p>YHVH is a just Elohim who weighs every claim. He sees not only what is taken or lost, but also the intent of the heart. Making a claim demands honesty; answering a claim requires humility; judging a claim requires impartiality.</p>

  <p><strong>Ask yourself today:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do I make claims truthfully, or do I exaggerate to secure advantage?</li>
    <li>Do I accept responsibility where it is mine, even when it is costly?</li>
    <li>Do I trust YHVH’s order of justice rather than defending myself through manipulation or pressure?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Lawful claims are not about winning disputes, but about preserving righteousness and peace within the community.</p>

  <h4>👐 PRAYER</h4>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, teach us to walk in justice and truth. Guard our hearts from false claims and unjust gain. Give us wisdom to act responsibly, humility to accept correction, and integrity to uphold what is right before You and before others. May our dealings reflect Your righteous order.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h3>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Shlishi Asiri 9, 6027 AA</h3>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h4>⭐ THEME</h4>
  <p>Just Claims Before YHVH</p>

  <h4>📘 READING</h4>
  <p>“You shall not pervert justice; you shall not show partiality, and you shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous.”<br />
     – Devarim (Deuteronomy) 16:19</em></p>

  <h4>🟫 FOCUS</h4>
  <p>The Torah distinguishes between what is lawful and what is just. A claim may be permitted by law, yet still be unrighteous if it ignores mercy, fairness, or the weight of consequences. YHVH calls His people not merely to assert rights, but to pursue justice that reflects His character.</p>

  <p>Just claims are restrained, measured, and accountable. They do not exploit technicalities, power, or vulnerability. They seek restoration rather than advantage, truth rather than victory, and peace rather than dominance.</p>

  <h4>🩵 REFLECTION</h4>
  <p>YHVH weighs not only the claim itself, but the heart behind it. Justice is corrupted when entitlement replaces compassion, or when winning becomes more important than what is right.</p>

  <p><strong>Ask yourself today:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do I press claims simply because I can, or because it is right?</li>
    <li>Do I consider the impact of my claims on others?</li>
    <li>Do I trust YHVH to defend justice, even when restraint costs me?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Just claims require humility — the willingness to step back when righteousness, not entitlement, demands it.</p>

  <h4>👐 PRAYER</h4>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, teach us to love justice as You do. Guard us from pressing claims that harm others or dishonor Your ways. Give us discernment to know when to claim and when to yield, and hearts that seek righteousness above personal gain. May our judgments reflect Your truth, mercy, and peace.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – YOM RISHON TISHI’I 23, 6027 AA</h2>

  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>⭐ THEME</h3>
  <p>Integrity That Guards Trust - Responsibility, Labor, and Covenant Faithfulness</p>

  <h3>📘 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall not oppress a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether one of your brothers or one of the strangers who are in your land within your gates. On the same day you shall give him his wages, and the sun shall not set on it, for he is poor and sets his heart on it; lest he cry against you to YHVH, and it be sin in you.”<br />
    - Devarim (Deuteronomy) 24:14-15
  </p>

  <h3>🟫 MITZVOT FOCUS</h3>
  <p>The Torah establishes clear standards for righteousness in everyday responsibility:</p>

  <p>The responsibilities of a paid guardian - one entrusted with another’s property is accountable to guard it faithfully and honestly.</p>

  <p>The obligations of a renter - temporary use does not remove responsibility; care and respect are required at all times.</p>

  <p>The mitzvah of timely remittance of wages - payment for labor must be given without delay.</p>

  <p>The prohibition against postponing payment - withholding wages endangers livelihood and violates covenant justice.<p>

  <p>These mitzvot protect the vulnerable and preserve trust within the community. YHVH ties righteousness not to status or intention, but to faithful action.</p>

  <h3>🩵 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>These instructions call us to examine how we handle responsibility that affects others.</p>

  <p>- Do we treat entrusted property as carefully as if it were our own?<br />
     - Do we recognize that delayed payment is not a minor inconvenience, but a burden placed on another’s life?<br />
     - Do our actions reflect an awareness that YHVH watches over fairness in the smallest details?</p>

  <p>Covenant faith is revealed in reliability. Integrity is lived out where trust and livelihood intersect.</p>

  <h3>👐 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>YHVH, teach us to walk uprightly in all our dealings. Give us hearts that honor trust, hands that act responsibly, and a spirit that respects the labor and dignity of others. May our daily conduct reflect Your justice and establish peace and stability among Your people.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

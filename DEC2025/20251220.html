  <h2><strong>🌟 SHABBAT MESSAGE – TISHI'I 29, 6027 AA 🌟</strong></h2>
  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3><strong>✨ THEME</strong></h3>
  <p>The New Jerusalem - Comfort, Restoration, and the Dwelling of Righteousness</p>

  <h3><strong>👐 OPENING PRAYER</strong></h3>
  <p>YHVH Eloheinu, as we enter Your Shabbat rest, draw our hearts into stillness and trust. Lift our eyes from the burdens of this age and fix them on the future You have promised. Let Your rest restore our strength and renew our hope, reminding us that You remain faithful to all You have spoken.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

  <h3><strong>🍷 COMMUNION</strong></h3>
  <p>Shabbat points us toward covenant fulfillment. As we remember Your faithfulness, we look ahead to the day when sorrow, injustice, and corruption are removed, and Your presence fills all creation. This rest is a sign of what is coming - renewal, peace, and wholeness established by Your hand.</p>

  <h3><strong>📜 TORAH READING</strong></h3>
  <p>“And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.”<br />
     - Shemot (Exodus) 25:8</p>

  <p>“And I will walk among you and will be your Elohim, and you shall be My people.”<br />
     - Vayikra (Leviticus) 26:12</p>

  <p>These verses reveal YHVH’s enduring desire - not distance, but dwelling among His people in holiness and order.</p>

  <h3><strong>📖 MESSAGE</strong></h3>
  <p>The vision of the New Jerusalem is the culmination of YHVH’s purpose from the beginning. From the Garden, to the Mishkan, to the Temple, Scripture consistently reveals a single direction - Elohim dwelling with humanity in righteousness. The New Jerusalem is not an escape from the world, but its healing.</p>

  <p>Shabbat allows us to step into that promise ahead of time. In a world marked by instability and loss, Shabbat declares that brokenness is temporary. The New Jerusalem stands as assurance that history is moving toward restoration, not collapse. What is faithful will endure. What is corrupt will be removed.</p>

  <p>This promise brings comfort because it is certain. YHVH does not abandon His creation; He redeems it. Shabbat trains our hearts to live now as citizens of what is coming - practicing peace, ordering our lives around truth, and trusting that YHVH completes what He begins.</p>

  <h3><strong>💙 APPLICATION</strong></h3>
  <p>As we rest today, we release control and reaffirm trust. Shabbat becomes an act of testimony, declaring that the future belongs to YHVH. By resting faithfully, we align our lives with the New Jerusalem’s values - righteousness, patience, and hope grounded in promise.</p>

  <h3><strong>👐 CLOSING PRAYER</strong></h3>
  <p>YHVH Eloheinu, establish our hearts in the certainty of the New Jerusalem You are preparing. Teach us to live as people shaped by what is coming, steady in faith and rich in hope. Let this Shabbat restore our joy and strengthen us as we await Your revealed glory.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

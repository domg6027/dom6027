  <h3>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – Yom Revi‘i, Asiri 10, 6027 AA</h3>
  <p><strong>Shalom, Mitspacha!</strong></p>

  <h4>⭐ THEME</h4>
  <p><strong>The Silent Camp Before Sinai</strong></p>

  <h4>📘 READING</h4>
  <p>“And the people encamped at the foot of the mountain.”<br />
     – Shemot (Exodus) 19:2</p>

  <h4>🟫 FOCUS</h4>
  <p>Before Sinai thundered with commands, the camp first learned silence. Yisrael arrived together, halted together, and waited together. No claims were argued, no disputes pressed, no voices elevated. Justice began not with laws spoken, but with a people restrained.</p>

  <p>This pause was not emptiness; it was alignment. A camp that cannot be still cannot receive justice. A people rushing to assert rights will distort judgment before it is ever spoken. YHVH required stillness so that justice would be received as instruction, not as ammunition.</p>

  <p>In this silence, entitlement was suspended. The strong did not speak over the weak. The eager did not outrun the hesitant. Justice was prepared in quiet, not in contention.</p>

  <h4>🩵 REFLECTION</h4>
  <p>Many injustices are born not from wickedness, but from haste. When we rush to defend ourselves, assert claims, or correct others, we often silence the very discernment justice requires.</p>

  <p><strong>Ask yourself today:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do I allow space before acting on a claim?</li>
    <li>Do I quiet my need to be right long enough to hear YHVH’s instruction?</li>
    <li>Do I create silence where justice can form, or noise where it fractures?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Justice received in stillness is harder to misuse.</p>

  <h4>👐 PRAYER</h4>
  <p>YHVH our Elohim, teach us the discipline of holy restraint. Still our hearts before we speak, judge, or claim. Prepare us to receive Your justice with humility and obedience, not urgency or pride. May our silence before You shape righteous action among others.</p>

  <p><strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>

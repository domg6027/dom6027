  <h2>📨 DAVAR LECHEM – TISHI'I 18, 6027 AA</h2>

  <p>Shalom, Mitspacha!</p>

  <h3>🌟 THEME</h3>
  <p>The Golden Calf Rebellion</p>

  <h3>📖 READING</h3>
  <p>“You shall have no other mighty ones against My face.”<br />
     - Shemot 20:3</p>

  <p>“They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them.”<br />
     - Shemot 32:8</p>

  <h3>✨ MESSAGE</h3>
  <p>The golden calf incident stands as one of the most sobering moments in the wilderness journey. While Moshe was on the mountain receiving the very words of YHVH, the people below turned impatience into idolatry. Yet even in judgment, we see YHVH’s enduring mercy — His willingness to restore those who return to Him.</p>

  <p>This moment reminds us how quickly distraction can pull hearts away, and how urgently we must guard our devotion to YHVH alone.</p>

  <h3>📖 REFLECTION</h3>
  <p>
    - Stay watchful — idolatry often begins subtly, not suddenly.<br />
    - Wait on YHVH; impatience can push people into dangerous decisions.<br />
    - Restoration is always possible when we turn back to Him with sincerity.<br />
  </p>

  <h3>🙌 PRAYER</h3>
  <p>
    YHVH our Elohim, keep our hearts steadfast in You alone. Strengthen us to wait on Your timing, trust Your leading, and reject every distraction that draws us away. Restore in us a pure devotion and guard us from the snares of idolatry.<br />
  </p>

  <p>Baruch YHVH.</p>

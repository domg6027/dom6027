  <h2>Introduction to Daily Prayer</h2>
  <p>In the Derech Olam, there are six daily prayers — three compulsory and three commendable. All prayers follow a shared Abrahamic structure consisting of two rakahot (cycles of standing, bowing, and prostration), aligned with the ancient worship of Avraham, Yitsḥaq, and Yaʿaqob.
  </p>

  <h3>Universal Changeover Proclamation</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>YHVH Gadol Me’od (YHVH is the greatest)</strong> is proclaimed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>At the beginning of the prayer</li>
    <li>At the beginning of every rakah</li>
    <li>Before every bodily change of position (standing, bowing, prostration, rising)</li>
    <li>Between completion movements within each rakah</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Opening Declaration (Once at the Beginning of the Prayer)</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Hear, o Yisrael, YHVH is our Elohim, YHVH is ONE.<br />
    And you shall love YHVH, your Elohim, with all your heart and with all your being and with all your might.<br />
    And these Words which I am commanding you today shall be in your heart,<br />
    and you shall impress them upon your children<br />
    and shall speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way<br />
    and when you lie down and when you rise up.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Universal Intention (Once at the Beginning of the Prayer)</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <em>I set my intention to stand before You, YHVH Elohim, to remember You, to give thanks to You, and to submit myself to Your will alone. Accept my prayer and direct my heart in truth.</em>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Opening Recitation (Start of Every Rakah)</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Search me, O Ĕl, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts;<br />
    And see if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the Way everlasting.
  </blockquote>

  <p>After the opening recitation, the appropriate texts for <strong>Rakah One</strong> or <strong>Rakah Two</strong> are recited.</p>

  <p>Following the rakah recitation, proclaim: <strong>YHVH Gadol Me’od</strong>, and then <strong>Hallelu-YHVH</strong> (three times) while raising your arms with your palms upwards.</p>

  <h3>Universal Completion (End of Every Rakah)</h3>
  <p>The completion sequence is performed for every rakah, with <strong>YHVH Gadol Me’od</strong> proclaimed between each change of position:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Full prostration:</strong> “Baruch YHVH.” - 3 times.</li>
    <li><strong>Sitting upright:</strong> “Todah va Yadah.”- 3 times.</li>
    <li><strong>Second prostration:</strong> “Baruch YHVH.” - 3 times.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Closing Greeting (End of Rakah Two)</h3>
  <p>After the completion of the second rakah, turn the head gently to the right and say: <strong>Shalom Aleichem.</strong><br>
    Then turn the head gently to the left and repeat: <strong>Shalom Aleichem.</strong></p>

  <p>This structure is repeated for every appointed prayer time, ordering the day through remembrance, submission, movement, and peace.</p>

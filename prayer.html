    <h2>Introduction to Prayers</h2>

    <p>In the Derech Olam, there are six daily prayers — three are <strong>compulsory</strong> and three are <strong>commendable</strong>. The compulsory prayers are commanded directly through Torah examples of our patriarchs and are observed by all faithful followers of YHVH. The commendable prayers are not required but are strongly encouraged for those who desire deeper communion with YHVH throughout the day.</p>

    <p><strong>Compulsory Prayers:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Qara Boker</strong> – Morning Prayer</li>
      <li><strong>Qara Natsah</strong> – Noon Prayer</li>
      <li><strong>Qara Nesheph</strong> – Evening Prayer</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Commendable Prayers:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Qara Ashmoret</strong> – Night Watch Prayer</li>
      <li><strong>Qara Tzohorayim</strong> – Midday Devotional Prayer</li>
      <li><strong>Qara Erev</strong> – Late Evening Reflection</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All prayers, whether compulsory or commendable, begin with thanksgiving, include the <strong>Shema</strong>, and conclude with prostration while saying <strong>“Baruch YHVH!”</strong></p>

  <!-- QARA ASHMORET -->
  <section>
    <h2>Qara Ashmoret (Night Watch Prayer)</h2>

    <p><em>Commendable Prayer</em></p>

    <p>The <strong>Qara Ashmoret</strong> is offered in the final watch of the night, just before dawn. It is a time of quiet reflection, repentance, and renewal before the day begins — a moment to realign the heart and mind with YHVH’s will.</p>

    <blockquote>
      When I remember You on my bed, and meditate on You in the night watches. For You have been my help, and in the shadow of Your wings I sing for joy.
      - <em>Tehillim (Psalm) 63:6–7</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Shema:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      "Hear, O Yisra’el: YHVH is our Elohim, YHVH is one! And you shall love YHVH your Elohim with all your heart, and with all your being, and with all your might. And these Words which I am commanding you today shall be in your heart, and you shall impress them upon your children, and shall speak of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up." <br />
      — <em>Debarim 6:4–7</em>

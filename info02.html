<h1>Paleo-Messianic</h1>
<h2>Covenant Theology Explained</h2>

<div class="section">
<p>Covenant is the central organizing structure of Paleo-Messianic belief. Scripture is not viewed as a collection of disconnected eras or replaced systems, but as one unfolding covenant revelation.</p>

<p>The covenant defines relationship, authority, identity, inheritance, and responsibility.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>What Is a Covenant?</h2>

<p>A covenant is a binding agreement initiated by YHVH, establishing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relationship</li>
<li>Obligations</li>
<li>Promises</li>
<li>Blessings and consequences</li>
<li>Inheritance structure</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout Scripture, covenant is the mechanism through which YHVH interacts with humanity.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>The Major Covenant Pattern</h2>

<h3>1. The Covenant with Avraham</h3>
<ul>
<li>Promise of land</li>
<li>Promise of descendants</li>
<li>Promise of blessing to the nations</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. The Covenant at Sinai</h3>
<ul>
<li>Torah given as instruction</li>
<li>Yisrael established as covenant nation</li>
<li>Shabbat given as sign</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. The Renewed Covenant Promise</h3>
<ul>
<li>Internalization of Torah</li>
<li>Heart transformation</li>
<li>Restoration of obedience</li>
</ul>

<p>Paleo-Messianic belief does not treat these as separate religions, but as progressive covenant unfolding.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Continuity, Not Replacement</h2>

<p>The covenant is not abolished when renewed. Renewal strengthens and restores the original agreement; it does not eliminate it.</p>

<p>The Messiah's role is understood as restoring covenant fidelity — not introducing a new, disconnected system.</p>
</div>

<div class="section highlight">
<h2>Renewal vs Replacement</h2>

<p>Paleo-Messianic belief rejects replacement theology. The covenant given to Yisrael remains the covenant structure. Those from the nations are grafted into this covenant — they do not create a new one.</p>

<p>There is one covenant body, one covenant law, and one covenant inheritance.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Torah Within Covenant</h2>

<p>Torah is not separate from covenant; it defines covenant living. It establishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Justice</li>
<li>Worship structure</li>
<li>Social responsibility</li>
<li>National identity</li>
<li>Holiness standards</li>
</ul>

<p>Obedience is not legalism. It is covenant loyalty.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>The Role of Faith</h2>

<p>Faith in Paleo-Messianic belief is covenant trust. It is expressed through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment with Torah</li>
<li>Trust in YHVH’s promises</li>
<li>Reliance on redemption through Messiah</li>
<li>Commitment to covenant living</li>
</ul>

<p>Faith and obedience are inseparable in covenant structure.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Covenant Identity Today</h2>

<p>The covenant remains active. It has not expired. It has not been transferred. It has not been spiritualized into abstraction.</p>

<p>It continues to define:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who belongs</li>
<li>How to live</li>
<li>What holiness means</li>
<li>What inheritance entails</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Paleo-Messianic Covenant Theology affirms:</p>
<ol>
<li>One continuous covenant framework</li>
<li>Torah as covenant instruction</li>
<li>Messiah as covenant restorer</li>
<li>Grafted inclusion of the nations</li>
<li>Future covenant fulfillment and restoration</li>
</ol>

<p>All theology flows from covenant continuity.</p>

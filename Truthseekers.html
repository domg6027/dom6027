      <h2>Welcome — I’m Magdalena</h2>
      <p>
        This is a quiet place for people who would rather ask hard questions
        than accept easy slogans. I’m not selling answers — I offer a lamp on
        the path and a steady hand for the journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to talk about life, meaning, or the strange things
        happening in the world, you’re welcome here.

      <h3>Does this sound like you?</h3>
      <p>
        You notice inconsistencies others ignore and want more than
        headlines. You prefer careful thought to loud certainty.
        You value honesty, not just comfort.

      <h3>What might seem wrong for a truth seeker — but isn’t</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Believing everything you read — truth seekers test.</li>
        <li>Thinking honest questions are naïve — they are the beginning.</li>
        <li>Assuming faith and reason must oppose — many find them together.</li>
        <li>Doing nothing out of fear — seeking is already a step forward.</li>
        <li>Thinking agreement is required — you are welcome even in disagreement.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>A subtle invitation</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re looking for thoughtful posts, images that provoke reflection,
        and respectful private conversation — this space exists for that.
      </p>
      <p>
        No pressure. No spectacle. Just clarity and a way forward.

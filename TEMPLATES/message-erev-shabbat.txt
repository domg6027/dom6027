🙌 EREV SHABBAT PRAYER
{{PRAYER_INTRO}}

We pray for peace in the Middle East, South Africa, and the world. Bring stability, righteousness, and divine intervention where conflict rises.

We pray for end-time revival. Let hearts awaken and turn back to Your truth across the earth.

We pray for the elderly, especially those suffering abuse or neglect. Surround them with protection, dignity, care, and comfort.

We pray for the farmers, especially those in danger of attacks. Shield their lives, strengthen their hands, and bless their labor.

We pray for evangelists across the world, especially where persecution is severe. Empower them with courage, safety, and supernatural doors of opportunity.

We pray for ill people, especially those with cancer and new viral outbreaks. Stretch out Your healing hand and bring restoration and hope.

We pray for the coming tribulation and the signs already appearing. Prepare our hearts with wisdom, endurance, and steadfast faith.

We pray for our ministry, Derech Olam Ministries. Guide each step, open the right doors, and let Your favor rest upon the work.

Baruch YHVH.

Shalom until tomorrow.
